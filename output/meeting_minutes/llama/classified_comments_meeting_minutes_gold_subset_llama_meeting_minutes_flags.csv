The second part of the comment seems to be a request for action, asking the organization to take a specific step (""give 4723 a first reading""). However, this does not necessarily imply a negative perception of homelessness or those affected by it. Instead, it appears to be a call to action aimed at promoting positive change. Therefore, the overall tone of the comment is constructive and supportive, rather than critical or dismissive. 

Overall, the speaker's language and tone suggest that they are advocating for greater recognition and protection for individuals experiencing homelessness, and are working within established frameworks to promote positive change. This aligns with the perception type of ""media portrayal,"" as the speaker is referencing existing legislation and regulations, and framing their advocacy in terms of building upon and expanding these existing structures.

For the first comment, the speaker seems to be expressing their opinion about a disputed location for homeless services. They mention that many homeless people congregate there, which suggests that they may view the location as problematic. However, they do not explicitly state their opinion, making it difficult to classify as either ""express their opinion"" or ""express others' opinions.""

"yes, I will say, there are cases where people just aren't satisfied, and what they're really not satisfied about is there is nothing that can really be done. These are complaints that are valid, it's frustrated, it's not that the officer did anything wrong. For example, we have immediate ated a number of cases that have unhoused population. And some feeling frustrated about calling the police and unhoused folks are still there, something like that. It's more complicated so we can talk about that in the mediation but ultimately is the encampment outside of somebody's house gone at the end? No, it's not. So there have been cased like that where people are frustrated that the underlying issue is not resolved and sometimes those are larger policy issues that volve a lot of other agencies as well. That has been the case in many situations with the 7%. Otherwise, we can remember one scenario where the complaintant did not feel like the officer was, just didn't really feel the officer, not that he did do anything, but she didn't connect with him and she didn't feel like he was owning up to what he had done, that's rare but that's an example of something that happened.",san francisco,"express their opinion, express others opinions","government critique, societal critique",solutions/interventions,"[harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]

We also are tasked with developing policies and procedures, requesting positions to meet our charter mandate. And what do we need? We need investigators to investigate our sheriff office cases. We also need a senior investigator to investigate review investigations and manage the sheriff department cases. Basically the senior investigator will supervise the investigators that are conducting the individual investigations. We have a assistant chief attorney who's really responsible for helping process public records requests to review and support investigations before they come to my desk, draft agreements and just assist with the overall running of the office of the inspector general. And of course we have a executive secretary that in addition to many roles also processes payroll and purchasing and provide administrative support. what is the proposed budget for the [ORGANIZATION] budget? We are here [ORGANIZATION] to present that at this public meeting. When looking at the budget we first wanted to look at the mayor's budget instructions and so what is the primary focus of the mayor's budget for [PERSON] and one is to improve public safety and the [STREET] conditions of [ORGANIZATION]. To promote city wide economic vitality and that goes hand in hand with public safety and [STREET] conditions. Reduce homelessness and transform mental health services. Mental health service delivery and just increasing the overall accountability, equity and spending of the budget. Now, this last section is very important because we are in [PERSON], and so all departments of [ORGANIZATION] are being asked to reduce their general fund support by 10% and through [ORGANIZATION]-through [LOCATION], DATE8, with also a possible additional 5% contingency you [DATE] be asked to reduce your budget so we could be looking at most departments a 15% budget reduction. With that in mind and being a new agency, we understood is we will probably given the difficult budget cycle that we are in, we are going to have to do a phased growth of [ORGANIZATION], so instead of asking for everything that we need to be an agency up and running, we understand we will have to phase the growth of our agency. Right now we are-we looked at what is the basic amount of funding we need to get up and running? We propose 2 mill $22.163.632. We feel that request allows to bring in the number of employees to get up and running independently as a agency. Because we are being asked to take a 10% cut, that cut is reflected in the $353.080 will amount to the cut we are taking out of our budget, which would leave at the proposed $2.163.632. Now, for the number of employees, our basic proposed budget we have 13 employees, and with the 10% cut, we would lose one of those employees so it would leave us at 12 employees under the current request for funding. And so what does that 10% look like? I told we would lose one employee that would be a investigator and also our non personal service amount to about $40 thousand leaving total of $221 thousand that reflect in the 10% reduction. We also have work orders because we are not able to fully-we are not fully funded at this point because we are a new agency,b then we have to rely on [LOCATION] to support our agency-excuse me, [ORGANIZATION] to support our agency with technology that will come in the form of about $62 thousand. We also would need accounting service from the [ORGANIZATION] controller's office, $53 thousand and investigative and administrative support, $480 thousand, and because we don't have our own in-house hr department, the county is providing us the hr rep and that will amount to $147 thousand. Now, what is the-our proposed budget is where we are requesting the funding, but we understand we had to pull back in [ORGANIZATION]. We are proposing that we are not asking for any increases in materials and supplies. We are not asking for any increases in non-personnel services. And not asking for any increases in salaries and benefits. We are really trying to work within the scope of understanding that we are in a difficult budget time, but at the same time, asking for the minimum of what we need to get our agency up and running and as a result we'll be relying heavily on the [ORGANIZATION] to support us and that will be in the form of $747 thousand. That will allow us to operate as the office of the inspector general. What are the impact of the reductions? Because we are not able to be a fully operational agency at this point given the budget constrictions, what is the impact of those reductions? Well, the original budget did not include funds for central personnel and infrastructure to meet the charter mandates, so these reductions will extend our reliance on borrowed support from the [ORGANIZATION], it will delay our ability to become fully operations and impair our ability to meet our core requirements laid out by the charter, 4.137. And it will also prevent our office from adding services for the community. And with that, if there are any questions, I'm very open to answering questions or ts anyone [DATE] have. And if there are no questions and comment, I appreciate everybody who tuned into watch the presentation, and I believe that's it.",san francisco,"express their opinion, provide a fact or claim",government critique,solutions/interventions,"media portrayal]

Overall, the speaker appears to be advocating for the rights and interests of current residents and promoting affordable housing. 

The second part of the text does not contain enough information to classify the perception type. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the speaker is likely referring to the potential displacement of low-income residents due to gentrification. This inference is supported by the speaker's emphasis on protecting current residents and promoting affordable housing. Therefore, the perception type can be classified as [harmful generalization] since the speaker is highlighting the potential negative consequences of gentrification on low-income residents. 

The speaker also expresses support for the recommendations and advocates for the rights and interests of current residents, which suggests that they do not hold a [deserving/undeserving] view of these individuals. Instead, they seem to recognize the importance of preserving affordable housing and promoting homeownership among low-income residents. 

Overall, the speaker's comments suggest that they are advocating for the rights and interests of current residents and promoting affordable housing, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes or biases. Therefore, the correct classification for the perception type is [harmful generalization]. 

Note: The classification of the perception type may vary depending on the interpretation of the context. However, based on the available information, the classification [harmful generalization] seems most appropriate.
