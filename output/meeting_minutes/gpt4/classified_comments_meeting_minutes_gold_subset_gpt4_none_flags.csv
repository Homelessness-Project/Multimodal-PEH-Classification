"yes, I will say, there are cases where people just aren't satisfied, and what they're really not satisfied about is there is nothing that can really be done.

And some feeling frustrated about calling the police and unhoused folks are still there, something like that. It's more complicated so we can talk about that in the mediation but ultimately is the encampment outside of somebody's house gone at the end? No, it's not.

"I am the new [ORGANIZATION] inspector general heading the offiof the inspector general, and as it was stated I'm here to present our proposed [ORGANIZATION] budget and I will start with telling you a little about [ORGANIZATION]. Basically, [ORGANIZATION] voters passed proposition d in [ORGANIZATION] establishing the [ORGANIZATION] first sheriff department oversight board, and that board proceeded to create the office of the inspector general and the whole purpose of the inspector general's office is provide independent oversight of the sheriff office. We have been assigned the government code or department code, sda to [ORGANIZATION]. The ORG2, roles and responsibilities are defined and [ORGANIZATION] charter section 4.137. then our oversight board appointed myself, [ORGANIZATION] as inspector general and on [LOCATION] we had a very beautiful administration of the oath by the legendary former mayor [PERSON] and [PERSON] which was created for oversight of the [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] continues to provide support of the ORG2 operation and assisting us with our independent investigations basically until we are fully staffed and up and running. Now, our role and responsibilities. We conduct the investigations of complaints filed against [ORGANIZATION] sheriff office employees and that includes the deputy sheriffs and their civilian employees and any third party contractors that they contract with. We also handle the investigations of any individual who dies while in the custody of the sheriff department. Additionally, once we conduct our investigations we also recommend disciplinary action to the sheriff. In terms of policies, what we are really looking to do is assist the sheriff department. We are also assisting with the development and recommending use of force policies for the sheriff department. We also look at the writing-reporting and auditing so we track and report on investigations, recommendations and outcomes and we monitor the sheriff office operations to insure compliance with the laws and policies. and we also conduct hearings. Most of those hearings roget right now are conducted by the oversight board but we have there authority to issue subpoena, administer oath, and take testimony. Now, our budget priorities. Well, our budget priorities are to recruit, hire, onboard and train staff because we are a new agency and so this is going to be one of our primary purposes getting the agency up and running. We also are tasked with developing policies and procedures, requesting positions to meet our charter mandate. And what do we need? We need investigators to investigate our sheriff office cases. We also need a senior investigator to investigate review investigations and manage the sheriff department cases. Basically the senior investigator will supervise the investigators that are conducting the individual investigations. We have a assistant chief attorney who's really responsible for helping process public records requests to review and support investigations before they come to my desk, draft agreements and just assist with the overall running of the office of the inspector general. And of course we have a executive secretary that in addition to many roles also processes payroll and purchasing and provide administrative support. what is the proposed budget for the [ORGANIZATION] budget? We are here [ORGANIZATION] to present that at this public meeting. When looking at the budget we first wanted to look at the mayor's budget instructions and so what is the primary focus of the mayor's budget for [PERSON] and one is to improve public safety and the [STREET] conditions of [ORGANIZATION]. To promote city wide economic vitality and that goes hand in hand with public safety and [STREET] conditions. Reduce homelessness and transform mental health services. Mental health service delivery and just increasing the overall accountability, equity and spending of the budget. Now, this last section is very important because we are in [PERSON], and so all departments of [ORGANIZATION] are being asked to reduce their general fund support by 10% and through [ORGANIZATION]-through [LOCATION], DATE8, with also a possible additional 5% contingency you [DATE] be asked to reduce your budget so we could be looking at most departments a 15% budget reduction. With that in mind and being a new agency, we understood is we will probably given the difficult budget cycle that we are in, we are going to have to do a phased growth of [ORGANIZATION], so instead of asking for everything that we need to be an agency up and running, we understand we will have to phase the growth of our agency. Right now we are-we looked at what is the basic amount of funding we need to get up and running? We propose 2 mill $22.163.632. We feel that request allows to bring in the number of employees to get up and running independently as a agency. Because we are being asked to take a 10% cut, that cut is reflected in the $353.080 will amount to the cut we are taking out of our budget, which would leave at the proposed $2.163.632. Now, for the number of employees, our basic proposed budget we have 13 employees, and with the 10% cut, we would lose one of those employees so it would leave us at 12 employees under the current request for funding. And so what does that 10% look like? I told we would lose one employee that would be a investigator and also our non personal service amount to about $40 thousand leaving total of $221 thousand that reflect in the 10% reduction. We also have work orders because we are not able to fully-we are not fully funded at this point because we are a new agency,b then we have to rely on [LOCATION] to support our agency-excuse me, [ORGANIZATION] to support our agency with technology that will come in the form of about $62 thousand. We also would need accounting service from the [ORGANIZATION] controller's office, $53 thousand and investigative and administrative support, $480 thousand, and because we don't have our own in-house hr department, the county is providing us the hr rep and that will amount to $147 thousand. Now, what is the-our proposed budget is where we are requesting the funding, but we understand we had to pull back in [ORGANIZATION]. We are proposing that we are not asking for any increases in materials and supplies. We are not asking for any increases in non-personnel services. And not asking for any increases in salaries and benefits. We are really trying to work within the scope of understanding that we are in a difficult budget time, but at the same time, asking for the minimum of what we need to get our agency up and running and as a result we'll be relying heavily on the [ORGANIZATION] to support us and that will be in the form of $747 thousand. That will allow us to operate as the office of the inspector general. What are the impact of the reductions? Because we are not able to be a fully operational agency at this point given the budget constrictions, what is the impact of those reductions? Well, the original budget did not include funds for central personnel and infrastructure to meet the charter mandates, so these reductions will extend our reliance on borrowed support from the [ORGANIZATION], it will delay our ability to become fully operations and impair our ability to meet our core requirements laid out by the charter, 4.137. And it will also prevent our office from adding services for the community. And with that, if there are any questions, I'm very open to answering questions or ts anyone [DATE] have. And if there are no questions and comment, I appreciate everybody who tuned into watch the presentation, and I believe that's it.",san francisco,"provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion",money aid allocation,solutions/interventions,"[]
