"I experience the same comments with non-benders in my car. It's tough because we want [ORGANIZATION] to be better, and there's been large improvements. But there is still a [ORGANIZATION] of work to be done. At this point, I feel as if the homeless issue is starting to hold back development and other progress in the city, mainly downtown. I can't stress enough how delicate and sensitive of an issue this is for [ORGANIZATION]. Agree or not, we are a liberal city, with quite a few Democrats in charge.

But here we are, with this issue in our laps. It doesn't matter so much as to how they got here. The real focus needs to be how to get them back onto their feet and self sufficient. There has been proven success with the housing first model. We don't have the capital to overnight the project and get results right away, so we are left in a holding pattern waiting for the first units to come online and gather data on how that works for us. 

I think this issue could actually be a fantastic opportunity for [ORGANIZATION] to step in.

"I just wanted to chime in that I think your question is so so so valid and I am glad you asked it. When you haven’t been around people experiencing active homelessness and potentially untreated mental health issues it can be scary at first bc let’s be real… all the unknown things and situations in our lives are scary for the most part- positive or negative. I am relieved to see all the posts on here educating and in support of giving humans a meal, electricity, and even a space to feel safe when they barely feel safe with their own thoughts.

"Hey neighbor, I live over here as well! 

I share a lot of your concerns, but we have to remember that this needs to go *somewhere*. Its probably going to have a negative impact wherever it goes, it just happens we drew the short straw this time. I already sent an email to [ORGANIZATION] (and I should probably send one to [PERSON] as well) requesting some more specifics on what the plan is to maintain the neighborhood. Id suggest you do the same. The more pressure, the better. When this happens, because it certainly sounds like its going to, we are going to have to try to make the most of it. We will have a vested interest in making sure the residents there succeed and receive the resources they are promised. We will also need to make sure we hold the city's feet to the fire to make sure they fulfill their promises to us and maintain our neighborhood. 

Thankfully this is a little different than a soup kitchen or shelter. Its actual housing, its designed for people who are maybe one step up from living on the streets, but still one step down from being on their feet enough to live in someplace like FAC0.

"The meeting was a great showing of varying community opinion. Went from [TIME].

\- PERSON0 got truly irate

\- PERSON1 (mayors office) got called out for unintentionally lying and providing partial information [ORGANIZATION] night to council. [TIME] before the meeting too.

\- The main guy from [ORGANIZATION] said FAC0 started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after [TIME] when there is no presence on site. Some lady from [ORGANIZATION] who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to [LOCATION] and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- [ORGANIZATION] got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until [TIME]) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- [ORGANIZATION] and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- PERSON2 of [ORGANIZATION] berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from ORG2 essentially said the same thing. [ORGANIZATION] also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes [TIME] the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which [ORGANIZATION] said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with [ORGANIZATION] apologized because they were voting against.

\- PERSON4 also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly [ORGANIZATION] employees, and people like PERSON4 who only took up [TIME] total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give [TIME] to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition [TIME]?

\- [ORGANIZATION] had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the [ORGANIZATION] project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the [STREET]. [ORGANIZATION] kept repeating they asked their consultant (DATE2) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as [ORGANIZATION] while giving numerous sites labels of [LOCATION]. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- PERSON6 tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter ([ORGANIZATION]) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""[INSTITUTION]"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. [ORGANIZATION] said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 [PERSON] meetings, 1 of which is attended. The [PERSON] barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in [ORGANIZATION] without a site in mind so then it became urgent in [LOCATION] to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around DATE4. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side? You going to find many free multiple acre properties in [PERSON]'s district?",southbend,"provide an observation, express others opinions","government critique, societal critique",,"[not in my backyard, harmful generalization]

"Yeah on my phone and trying to figure out how to share a [ORGANIZATION]. It's 20-22 units, they have leases, and some pay a small portion of rent but not usually. Originally (DATE0) it was a part time maintenance person, [TIME] a week apt/community manager, and [TIME] a week for a off-duty cop. RA may live on site but they would have to go to the state for approval, likely be difficult, and not in plans currently.

There would be on site visits from [ORGANIZATION] (recovery coach) but for their caseworker it sounds like they would pick up individuals and bring them to [ORGANIZATION]. Same for mental health and addiction services.  [ORGANIZATION] would have 2 case managers available, not solely dedicated. The homeless individual has the choice to participate.

"Thanks for your thoughtful response. 

I'm curious how large complexes are more harmful? And I also thought [ORGANIZATION] doesn't allow visitors or drugs. Maybe a safe injection site is also needed so people aren't shooting up in people's yards. I think it was a little misguided that the director of [ORGANIZATION] said homelessness was done for with [ORGANIZATION] running. 

To the point of something outside the city, good luck getting the county to agree to that. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] hate homeless people to the point of calling them garbage. The county commissioners don't want to fund anything that isn't already a running program or a giant corporation trying to move in. [ORGANIZATION] didn't even pay attention to the meeting, just got the [INSTITUTION] to shut things down(there were clearly too many people, but that was an observation I had). Honestly if [ORGANIZATION] stops getting funded by the county I'm all down for camping in [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] till he changes his mind.",southbend,"provide a fact or claim, ask a genuine question, express their opinion","government critique, societal critique",solutions/interventions,"harmful generalization, not in my backyard]

"I like some of his ideas but I have a better chance being a pro basketball player than [ORGANIZATION] does consolidating departments or initiatives with [PERSON]. Him thinking that's possible makes me question if he's just saying that to get away with the ""how will you pay for this"" question than it either shows willful misleading or not understanding the dynamic between the two cities.

He seems to be trying to be the best of both worlds and say ""hey if you like [ORGANIZATION] and where the city is going I'm your guy but also hey [ORGANIZATION] is overrated and the city needs a lot of work"" it's an interesting strategy. I think he actually has a more critical view of [ORGANIZATION] and the city government than he let's on (which there is nothing wrong with) that I wish he would just come out in the open and say so the debate could be better.

Edit - For example it's easy to say the city is ""screwing around"" with the homeless situation, but to not give what you would actually so different. The city had a decent homeless initiative that was stopped by residents in unison saying you're not putting transition centers in ""my neighborhood"". So how do you get past that? What is he going to do to fix the problem besides, say, not screwing around? Whatever that even means. Considering it's a top 3 initiative of his, he's provided no details whatsoever. 

He wants it all by saying, hey if you like the current administration, vote for me!

"So, I've changed a lot on this one over time. I spent [ORGANIZATION] as an advocate working against chronic homelessness, have participated on some of the city's [LOCATION] on homelessness, etc, but I don't think the city, nor this take are being entirely generous.

1 - yes, housing first is scientifically the most effective model for caring for the homeless. It's math, not feelings. It [LOCATION] - but... housing first doesn't give free license to do housing first poorly. there are ways to do zero barrier in ways that are more harmful and less harmful.3 - less harmful = scattered site. less harmful = day shelter programming and a more controlled check in/check out process. more harmful = large complexes. more harmful (to the community) = no day programming, free roaming, full freedom, full visitation (allows for drug dealers)4 - Motels4Now has been good for the homeless, but harmful for many near it. It just has. Businesses have closed, people feel less safe, and it decreases the dignity and pride of the people near it (who - as those on the [ORGANIZATION] side - have already dealt with a lot of disinvestment). I'm not sure it's fair to help some people by harming some others, especially when it's just due to not being willing to produce the funding to do it in a [STREET] that is even more helpful and less harmful.I think at this point my preference would be something outside of city limits, on the edge of town where there's still zero restrictions on sobriety, but still a more programmatic or controlled environment. And let's pay for a shuttle that can connect people to the bus line. Surely a small shuttle bus and a full-time driver is within financial reason, given the total project will cost millions anyway.

I'm not saying my idea is the best one. But we at least have to have some compassion for the real expressed needs of neighbors and business owners without painting them out to be petty or greedy.

I lived on FAC0 for DATE0. Had plenty of homeless stop by when I was working in the yard asking for handouts or offering to work for money.

"The volunteering has bothered me for quite a while like you said, these people cannot even feed let  alone house themselves yet they’re down there donating their time which could be better spent looking for a job. Now the situation is so dire that a food train is needed to feed these volunteers. Again, wouldn’t they be better served finding a job? The thing that mainly bothers me, though is the pictures and the videos. We’re talking about people who are in the throes of their addiction, in the middle of detoxing, or fresh out of rehab or suffering from mental illness . Of course if she asked them to take a picture of video they’re going to say yes, they feel obligated to say yes, would be my guess, some of them probably feel like if they don’t say yes, she won’t help them, or they won’t be able to be down there ,or worse be ostracized once again in their lives. . She is a master manipulator and things don’t have to be said, in order to be understood.  Don’t get me started on the children’s picture being blasted out there. For instance, the last one with [ORGANIZATION] and her husband/abuser/trafficker and those poor kids. Now of course they will consent to a picture, because after all [PERSON] saved them!  And it makes complete sense for all their friends and strangers to know the horrors these children endured before their parents got clean. Lastly no one and I mean NO one should be cleaning up a person who has soiled themselves.  They don’t have the facilities for that and not one person, [PERSON] or her homeless volunteers are trained to do that .  Especially to someone in a wheelchair who probably has a multitude of medical issues and if not properly handled could be seriously injured.

"Pretty strong rhetoric here. [ORGANIZATION] administers both homeless prevention assistance and housing assistance for thousands of people [ORGANIZATION]. And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. [ORGANIZATION] literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at [TIME] to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG2 does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

I'm very sorry to hear that you're having a hard time keeping up with building codes. I hope that you can make the adjustments required for you to continue helping people in a [STREET] that's safe, and I hope that you're able to continue to increase what you do for the community.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses disagreement with a previous viewpoint and claims that efforts have been made but still acknowledges worsening conditions. They also imply that some homeless individuals may avoid or antagonize the care system, which can lead to harmful generalizations about the homeless population. The statement does not contain any explicit or implicit racial bias. 

The reasoning includes the acknowledgment of worsening homelessness conditions while disagreeing with another perspective, along with the implication that some homeless individuals might actively avoid or antagonize support systems, which can contribute to negative perceptions of the homeless community without directly attributing these behaviors to race. Therefore, there is no evidence of racial bias in this comment.

"A lot of people commenting are assuming the people she's helping have a phone and can call for help themselves. Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss [PERSON]'s bc they know she has [LOCATION] and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break. 

I am not saying that there is or isn't a reason to be concerned, I don't know either [STREET], but some of the comments are petty [ORGANIZATION]. She's asking for immediate donations of food, shows the lack of food and the line of people and when the food is delivered they see the hungry people. She goes live all the time and shows the volunteers, donations and those she's helping. I think she is helping them and that those complaining or questioning haven't proven otherwise. 

I don't see anyone else in the neighborhood helping our most vulnerable residents 24/7 with a sack lunch and no questions asked. Everyone deserves and needs food to survive.",rockford,"provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions","government critique, societal critique",solutions/interventions,"deserving/undeserving, harmful generalization]

"I will try to save everyone [TIME] of their life by summarizing the Live video.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed a few complaints on her fb page.  First, she addressed the gal who expressed frustration of clothes, personal care bags, food, razors, feminine products being dumped around her home.  The woman asked miss [ORGANIZATION] volunteers to come pick it up since it’s a regular problem.  [ORGANIZATION] addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets [ORGANIZATION] while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.  That doesn’t happen anymore,  but instead it became the neighbors problem.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at [ORGANIZATION]’s a few times and was angry at how she wasn’t helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed it saying it’s because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers aren’t sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her [STREET] is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is [ORGANIZATION] register [ORGANIZATION] may turn out to be a blessing for her, per [ORGANIZATION] (not in those words).  She can’t comment on the article per the board, but so many people have offered support since the article so these things may get addressed by volunteers in the community.  I feel so bad for these businesses being sucked into this when the economy hasn’t been the best for all lines of business.  Do they know she raised $400k for a $175k building?  I also felt bad for the Mexican restaurant donating so many meals DATE2.  I hope the food goes to those that need it, but cash flow at restaurants has been tough since [PERSON] and inflation.

"1) Its close to [ORGANIZATION]. I love that its really quick to jump on the highway and be there in [TIME] or so. housing is less expensive

2) I hate the crime and gang violence that spills out of the west side of [PERSON]. it also acts like a catch all for the riff raff coming out of [ORGANIZATION]. the homeless is a growing issue too. 

The roads are crap because you get the worst of [ORGANIZATION] being down well below 0 for [LOCATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] are well above the 90s for [LOCATION]. the springs and falls are nice but its [ORGANIZATION] of each. 

[PERSON] is also a highly industrial area, except that was [PERSON]. alot of empty rusted dilapidated buildings that hipsters start a business in for [PERSON] then go under.

this area is extremely blue collar, the only thing that they like to do is go to bars. Not really a music or art culture here. just bars. 

people here cant [STREET] worth a shit. guys in [ORGANIZATION] are still wearing skater shoes with chain wallets. Moms smoke in their cars with their babies listening to papa roach. 

since they passed a gambling law, there are slots on every corner and in every [STREET] imaginable. They also passed another granting [PERSON] to build a casino [PERSON] or DATE8. So the people that live paycheck to paycheck that already have problems can go to surrender what they have left. But the city gets a bit of the profit, which you'll never see get implemented to benifit you in any [STREET]

3) I wish [PERSON] had one [STREET] that wasnt constantly covered in trash.

4) I would vist the surrounding towns in [PERSON], or even GPE2. but each town will have its own challenges. like when a chemical tool plants explodes and burns for [ORGANIZATION]#x200B;

Final thoughts: You might need to reconsider what youre willing to sacrifice for what you hope to gain. The [ORGANIZATION] is just one big cornfield of poverty. Im personally biased in that I hope a nuclear bomb goes off in this city. I would say that maybe just rent for [LOCATION]0 to experience the seasons and they [STREET] people act like here. Sure we dont have [ORGANIZATION] like you do in [LOCATION], but we have plenty of suicidal alcoholic domestic abusers that fly their freak flag here. So its a trade off. If you do decide to move here, make sure you lock your doors at [TIME] and chain down what you dont want stolen.

Now, analyze this comment:
""I've seen firsthand how these people are just lazy and don't want to work.""
To analyze the given comment, we will follow the provided instructions step-by-step.

### Analysis:
**Comment Type:** [express their opinion, harmful generalization]
- **Express Their Opinion**: The commenter is sharing their personal view on the behavior of homeless individuals.
- **Harmful Generalization**: The phrase ""these people are just lazy and don't want to work"" suggests a broad and negative stereotype about the entire group of homeless people.

**Critique Category:** []
- There is no direct criticism of money aid allocation, government policies, or societal norms mentioned in the comment.

**Response Category:** []
- The comment does not discuss any specific solutions or interventions.

**Perception Type:** [deserving/undeserving]
- The comment implies that the homeless individuals being discussed do not deserve assistance based on the perceived laziness and unwillingness to work.

**Racist:** [No]
- While the comment contains a harmful generalization about homeless people, it does not explicitly or implicitly refer to race.

**Reasoning:** 
- The commenter is expressing their personal opinion about the behavior of homeless individuals, specifically labeling them as lazy and unwilling to work. This is a harmful generalization that can lead to negative perceptions and judgments about the deservingness of help. However, the comment does not mention race, so it cannot be classified as containing racial bias. The perception type here is ""Deserving/Undeserving"" because the commenter is making a judgment about whether the homeless individuals should receive help based on their perceived lack of effort.

"The city has been practicing the [ORGANIZATION] program for [ORGANIZATION].  What housing first does is provide shelter first, and then addresses the person's other issues.  The city also put a lot of people up in rooms during [PERSON] because they got funding for it.  It makes no sense that [ORGANIZATION] would pay for people's rent. The city has been so successful with [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] is a model for other cities.  The city also collaborates with other agencies to reduce overlap and gaps.  However, the city employees can't post on social media about what they do.  [ORGANIZATION] rarely speaks of the work and programs of the city and other agencies.  

It isn't compassionate to supply people to live rough indefinitely, and put a strain on community spaces when bedding, tents, clothing, and food waste are dumped and abandoned buildings go up in flames.  It is reckless to give people hope that they can live sustainably with a cup of ramen, a few blankets and a tent in [LOCATION].  That is why no other agency in town provided materials to live outdoors, they provide shelter first.  However, the city can't force anyone to accept help, so there will always be un-sheltered people.

"Most of those funds go to programs for housing and homeless prevention.They, for a while, also could go towards temporarily sheltering people. So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for [ORGANIZATION], or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for [LOCATION].  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in [STREET], and certain things that these funds simply can't help with. 

Then there's a couple programs that help people pay utility bills, but those are usually paid for with funds that are separate from what I was talking about before.",rockford,"provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion",money aid allocation,solutions/interventions,"not in my backyard, harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]

To further elaborate on the perception type, the phrase ""ain't homeless people"" can be seen as a way of distancing the issue from homeless individuals themselves, potentially leading to harmful generalizations about the group as a whole. However, the comment does not contain explicit or implicit racial bias, hence it is classified as 'No' under racism.

Now, analyze the following comment using the same format:

""I've been homeless myself, and I know firsthand how hard it is to get back on your feet. We need to start providing more job training programs and mental health support.""
Certainly! Here’s the analysis based on the provided format:

Comment Type: [provide an observation, express their opinion]
Critique Category: []
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [personal interaction]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter shares a personal experience of being homeless, which falls under the category of providing an observation. They then express their opinion that more job training programs and mental health support are needed to assist those experiencing homelessness. There is no critique of money aid allocation, government policies, or societal norms, nor is there any mention of harmful generalizations or judgments about deservingness. Therefore, no critique category applies. The perception type is categorized as personal interaction due to the direct personal experience shared.

This is exactly the issue exemplified in a lot of ways.

* Providing housing is a risky (leveraged) profit-making endeavor rather than a more stable public good
* When people don't have housing, it's much harder for them to actually spend time finding a steady job or other source of income

I know you'll say that that's not your problem, but that's the issue. Who can be accountable for the unhoused other than those who provide housing?

"Yeah, but specifically how? 

Tax rates for the wealthy are going down, not up. As you've seen in [ORGANIZATION] now, passing anything, even with democrats in power, is nearly impossible. Including tax hikes (fun fact: the bill being debated right now - is more than 25% tax cuts. As in the infrastructure bill is more than 25% tax cuts. And the Democrats are...in power, not the Republicans).

People always have simple answers to big problems, and these simple answers solve none of the problems. It is actually.... probably the saddest thing I've witnessed, in general over my life. 

We've said we would solve so much. Climate change, gun violence, equality, social mobility - and we've made zero progress on any of these. We've made negative progress, even. We can't even legalize marijuana at the federal level. 

Here's a simple solution to solving climate change; just do it. Just do it. Easy, right?

People on this subreddit keep asking the same questions, and providing the same simple answers. And yet they are amazed that they are unsatisfied with the results. Here's what the people asking these questions don't want to hear; invite the homeless in to your house. Or take your paycheck, and buy a house for the homeless person, or buy the homeless person a [ORGANIZATION] at a hotel. These are actual solutions that any of us can do. It just takes sacrifice from us. How many of us do you see making these sacrifices? None. 

We literally cannot even raise taxes. So it's just.... exhausting in a sense (trying to... demonstrate the gridlock, the partisanship, the need for solutions that can actually pass [PERSON]).

Comment Type: ask a genuine question, provide an observation
Critique Category: none
Response Category: none
Perception Type: none
racist: No
Reasoning: The comment is asking for insight into common scenarios leading to homelessness and seeks to understand the backgrounds of individuals experiencing homelessness. It does not contain any explicit or implicit racial bias, nor does it criticize money aid allocation, government policies, or societal norms directly. There are no suggestions for solutions or interventions provided, and no perceptions of personal interactions, media portrayals, opposition to local developments, harmful generalizations, or judgments about deservingness expressed. 

The question aims to gather information on the lived experiences and circumstances surrounding homelessness, which can lead to a better understanding and empathy towards those affected by it. Therefore, it falls under ""ask a genuine question"" and ""provide an observation."" Since there's no indication of racial bias, it is classified as ""No."" 

Note: The comment also implicitly invites others to share their observations and thoughts, making it partially fit within ""express others' opinions,"" but the primary focus is on seeking genuine insights rather than expressing opinions. Thus, ""ask a genuine question"" takes precedence.

Reasoning: The comment is primarily seeking genuine insights into the common scenarios leading to homelessness and inviting others to share their perspectives. It does not involve any form of critique or propose any responses or solutions. There is no indication of racial bias or negative perceptions based on race. Hence, it fits best under ""ask a genuine question"" and ""provide an observation.""

"You literally did not say that. And other people ALSO took the same meaning. In a conversation about increased homelessness, you brought up the bikes lanes giving them more places to be. You did NOT bring up that it just makes them more visible. Those aren’t the same thing. The increased number of homeless people in [ORGANIZATION] is a persistent discussion, and their visibly is not. Have you, sincerely, never heard someone make a comment about it homeless people congregating in cities based on infrastructure? I’d find that hard to believe. 

I’m not mad about this, the [STREET] you seem to be. I am, frankly, a little confused by your immature reaction. “Hey, I misspoke, here’s what I meant” is a mature and normal reaction to have. A well adjusted person’s reaction, one could say. I said, in my comment, “I don’t know if that’s what you actually meant,” which was a clear invitation to clarify (clear… if someone had decent reading comprehension skills lmao). I just find it kind of hilarious that your reaction to a fairly calm comment was to jump to “gO tOuCh [PERSON] BaSeMeNt DwElLeR!!”, when that is perhaps the most ‘chronically online’ response someone could have to a simple correction on their language or point. Also, I never said that you implied the bikes lanes were created to give them a [STREET] to hang out, but rather that it sounded like you correlated bikes lanes with an increased homeless population. 

Also, as one last point “stop reading things that aren’t there” is a hilarious response here, when good reading comprehension is literally defined as the ability to read between the lines (IE: reading things that aren’t [explicitly] there)",kzoo,"provide an observation, express their opinion",,,"[harmful generalization]

"realistically speaking, how much does it cost to maintain a home [ORGANIZATION]? I am asking genuinely. I am a homeowner for [ORGANIZATION], and it seems to me that [ORGANIZATION], my maintenance costs are ***significantly*** lower than what my rent was prior to buying a larger house in a better neighborhood.

>who's going to pay for it?

The community, but more to the point, land and housing costs are artificially high for reasons I stated in my original comment. Abolish (at the least) corporate landlords and see where the chips fall. I suspect the cost of living would be much better for everyone, myself a homeowner included. 

>Who's going to maintain it

The same ones that maintain it now - contractors. at best, landlords serve as a (very expensive) middleman between the tenet and the contractor. 

>Who's going to accept liability for the property?

The community. we pay more taxes keeping our homeless population alive than we would maintaining housing for them.

Comment Type: ask a genuine question
Critique Category: government critique
Response Category: None
Perception Type: None

Reasoning: The commenter is asking for clarification on how a shutdown relates to increased homelessness at a specific organization. This is a genuine inquiry seeking understanding rather than expressing an opinion or making a judgment. It does not pertain to money aid allocation, solutions, perceptions, or contain any racial bias. To further clarify, the question could imply criticism of the organization's handling of homelessness during a shutdown but is phrased neutrally. Therefore, it falls under 'government critique' by extension since shutdowns can be seen as a governmental action affecting organizations. However, this is more of an indirect critique rather than a direct one. There is no indication of racial bias in the comment. 

Note: The original response was slightly modified to better fit the provided format and to ensure clarity. The term ""PEH"" was replaced with ""homelessness,"" which is more appropriate given the context. The comment type was adjusted from ""ask a rhetorical question"" to ""ask a genuine question"" based on the content provided. The critique category was expanded to include both 'government critique' and'money aid allocation,' acknowledging the potential implications of the shutdown on funding and policy. The perception types were left blank as they did not directly relate to the content of the comment. The racist classification remained ""No."" The reasoning was elaborated to explain the choices made regarding each category.

"I get what you’re saying, but free phones and phone service can be easy to obtain. The government cellphones don’t cost a thing. I see booths set up around my part of town (e. FAC0) that encourage people to come sign up for a free phone. 

And tbh the world of technology we live in now considers a cell phone to be a basic need, and rightfully so. There aren’t any more pay phones, or they are at least few and far between. Society is dependent on technology. Being homeless is hard enough. I despise that these asshats ruined the park for such a long time, but they are people. They are humans. They are important to someone, even if they aren’t even a blip on my radar, every person in that park has value and is special and important to someone. They deserve basic human kindness and it is society’s duty to care for and support each other. I am totally ok with my tax dollars being used to buy a phone and service for someone who can’t do it for themselves. Life is already hard enough. We can provide this support to have available basic human needs. 

I do get what you’re saying. I was jealous of the camp sites down there. They got better shit than I do. And I work my ass off to keep my head just above water. But it is a little bit on the ignorant side to just assume that a homeless person should not be entitled to basic needs. Or even something better. They have it rough enough, and maybe they don’t want to be pitied, maybe that’s condescending, but show some compassion. It goes a long [STREET]. :) 


Sorry for the long reply. It’s a lot of reading, but Im on my [ORGANIZATION] so I’m hyper, and I’m feeling emotional because of hormones.

"The difficulty with issues like homelessness is that much money has gone into addressing it without success. Just housing everyone who is homeless doesnt work. American society in general provides ample opportunity despite what some may tell you to provide for yourself. Some choose not to do this, and some unfortunately are incapable despite the opportunity that is present (No modern solution can help these people. A surprisingly large percentage of the population has an iq too low even for the military. Here is an area of research where in which you could come up with a revolutionary solution!) If this were not the case immigrants would not risk their lives to come here and find success. This is still the land of opportunity.

Reasoning: The comment is asking a rhetorical question and expressing an opinion linking capitalism and affordable housing, criticizing both economic and social systems without making any direct claims about race. It does not fit into other categories provided. 

Note: The comment could potentially fall under ""government critique"" due to its questioning of tax burden's impact on housing affordability, but it primarily serves as a rhetorical device rather than providing a direct critique. Similarly, while it touches on societal critiques by implying systemic failures, it doesn't delve deeply enough into societal attitudes or norms to fully qualify there either. Therefore, the primary classifications align more closely with the rhetorical nature and opinion expressed.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

Your turn! Here's another one to analyze:
""Isn't it just easier to give homeless people money instead of building shelters and other facilities? Wouldn't that solve the problem faster?""

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the Comment Type**:
   - The commenter is asking whether giving money directly to homeless individuals would be more effective than providing shelter and other facilities.
   
2. **Identify the Critique Category**:
   - This comment touches on the allocation of resources and the effectiveness of different forms of assistance.
   
3. **Identify the Response Category**:
   - The commenter is suggesting a solution (giving money directly).
   
4. **Identify the Perception Type**:
   - The perception here seems to involve a judgment about the efficacy of different types of support for homeless individuals.
   
5. **Determine if there is any Racial Bias**:
   - There is no explicit or implicit racial bias in the comment.

Now, let's put it together:

The sex offender problem is sort of tied up in the rest of this. We (rightly) do not want people who prey on children living close to where children congregate- but then we don’t have anywhere else for those people to go. They wind up homeless, no fixed address, and then if they do reoffend it’s harder to find them.

There should be a monitored halfway house for those kinds of offenders- but that’s a small number of the total unhoused population.

- **Comment Type**: ""Express Their Opinion"" because the commenter is expressing their view on how to interact with homeless individuals. ""Express Others' Opinions"" because they suggest using an organization, implying this might be what others believe too.
  
- **Critique Category**: None, as there's no direct criticism of money aid allocation, government policies, or societal norms.

- **Response Category**: None, as there’s no discussion of specific solutions or interventions.

- **Perception Type**: ""Harmful Generalization"" due to the use of the term ""cockroaches,"" which can be seen as a harmful stereotype. ""Personal Interaction"" because the suggestion is to engage through an organization rather than directly.

- **Racist**: Yes, because the term ""cockroaches"" is a derogatory reference that can imply negative racial stereotypes.

- **Reasoning**: The use of ""cockroaches"" is a clear example of harmful generalization and racial stereotyping. Suggesting engagement through an organization rather than directly may reinforce these harmful perceptions.

"Considering how half of homeless people have employment -- or live at a shelter with a list of crazy rules (can't enter after [TIME], for example), then it's not effective).

Alternatively, peg minimum wage to rent rates in the region.

> About 53 percent of the sheltered homeless had formal labor market earnings in [DATE] they were observed as homeless, and the authors’ find that 40.4 percent of the unsheltered population had at least some formal employment in [DATE] they were observed as homeless.

Content to analyze:
""""I don’t think we should build more shelters in our city. We already have enough. The homeless just move around to different cities until they find one where they can get free housing. They’re taking advantage of us.""

This is a common argument I hear from people who oppose building new shelters in their area. It’s frustrating because it perpetuates the idea that homeless people are simply moving around to take advantage of other communities' generosity, rather than addressing the root causes of homelessness.

"Thank you for your summary of why the two resolutions' differing origins matters so much, this is what I am hoping to raise awareness of the most.

[PERSON]'s thoughts on the people's resolution:

>“It resonated as a stand alone, attention seeking, self aggrandizement, document in my eyes, which actually ignored our current efforts, did not build upon or improve our existing efforts, was condescending toward staff’s actual hard work in this arena, and was disappointing…. an opportunity for a rather small group of individuals to sufficiently stack the deck to speak, with their preferred track force members in order to gain more influence than they currently possess.”

"There were **two competing housing resolutions** that were introduced to [ORGANIZATION] [TIME].

1. One was crafted by citizens through grass-roots groups like ORG1, ORG2, others) and asked for a Housing Crisis be declared, a committee/task force formed, and a city staff member hired to focus on solutions.
2. The other was sponsored by five [ORGANIZATION] members and proposed no action, but made a declaration of efforts they've taken to address housing. PERSON0 led this one and the FOIA'd e-mails made him seem offended that other's hard work was going unnoticed.

Read more here: [[URL]

What I think was strange about [PERSON]'s version was that it over-emphasized the [ORGANIZATION]'s efforts on housing insecurity and homelessness. Those are important things that align with my personal values, but that's not what we're talking about. We need to increase housing supply and expedite its production so that people just have options of places to live. I believe we're making steady progress doing this like removing commercial parking requirements, creating pre-approved design plans for infill developments downtown, FAC0 improvement plan...but there are some critical approaches we have not addressed. They are local actions that impact housing supply and local prices:

* **Hire another planner or two** to work with landowners to rezone more properties to allow housing in more places (e.g. FAC0 improvement project that's underway or our [ORGANIZATION] in our [ORGANIZATION] Plan 2040 our city refuses to act on). 
* You know those brownstones in [ORGANIZATION]? Triple-deckers in [PERSON]? They are illegal to build in most of our city due to zoning. **Reform our development code.** I believe it's a problem that it's easier to build sprawling subdivisions, and harder to build compact and traditional living. We need to change the code from [ORGANIZATION] zoning to form-based zoning. [PERSON] and [PERSON] are addressing this with a world-renowned consultant right now. If [PERSON] chooses to fall behind those two cities in urban planning, it will be laughable. 
* **Reduce/reform parking minimums** for residential (maybe using overlay districts) and simultaneously invest in transit. [PERSON] is offering cities in [PERSON] a match for transit investment (design of bus stops) and the [ORGANIZATION] has not taken them up on it. 
* [ORGANIZATION] councilmembers: **Stop holding rezone requests hostage.** 

Personally, I'm mostly annoyed that it seems several councilmembers don't recognize that [PERSON] **has made great progress** ***and*** **can do more.** There IS work to be done ...do they see that? I'm concerned that they know, they just don't want it.

"Copying my comment from r/fayettevillear 

It has gotten out of hand. They are taking over walker park. I’ve seen many tents in the woods in the disk golf course. A little further south down the greenway, there are tons of tents in the woods and often times when riding my bike on the trails I would run into some pretty scary figures. I haven’t been back since I’ve been scared of being robbed of my bike..

Riding in [DATE] I probably saw at least 20 tents along the greenway in a 3 mile ride from FAC0 to FAC1. It was like they were everywhere.

Also a huge homeless encampment on the north side of the greenway here:

36.[ZIP]° N, 94.[ZIP]° W

I have been there before and it looked like an entire city of homeless, yet that was [ORGANIZATION] and may be cleared up. I am glad this is getting attention.

"Agreed.  Have lived here since [ORGANIZATION].  I staunchly defended our city’s reputation when [ORGANIZATION], etc started constant coverage of a “liberal woke city being completed mismanaged by corrupt politicians leading to drugs, crime and massive homeless population”. I am very sad to say I can’t defend the city anymore, I see it DATE1.  It’s clearly mismanaged city and it’s clearly failed policy and politicians with agendas leading to a complete mess.  If it wasn’t surrounded by natural beauty it would be completely fuxked versus right now it’s only mostly fucked.  I don’t have an answer for homelessness or drugs or crime but it’s clear the ultra liberal approach is not working.

"I’m curious, what exactly did you do to help before? I ask because, as someone formerly homeless I literally had maybe a handful of people who actually offered any kind of material help and usually it really wasn’t much.

In fact, when I was denied [ORGANIZATION] benefits for the second time because I was foolish enough to mention during the phone interview, after all the paperwork I completed and having to wait [ORGANIZATION] for the opportunity to get  1 phone call I better not miss or have to start all over, that I mentioned I sometimes would prepare and have meals with my girlfriend. And I was denied because I refused to do as they ask and go to this woman, one of the few people who actually stood by me and saw me get out of that situation, my real guardian angel, that I felt it was inappropriate for me to then have to ask her for her [ORGANIZATION], every detail of her personal finances, ask for her college transcript, take all this very detailed personal information making her vulnerable to whoever had it and turn it over to the county and state just so I could get a couple hundred a month I could use and only use making sure I, at the very least, had food in my stomach.

When I was a homeless man, asking one of the very few programs that offer any kind of help or relief just for the help of food was denied that help. And to have that be the second time of paperwork and waiting and phone interviews and then waiting some more just to find out that our system denied a working homeless person who because of pride had put off even asking for help until I realized why not her help if it’s there. That’s when I realized it actually wasn’t there.

People talk a lot about “all the things the homeless get” and as you said yourself they’re “freeloaders” without realizing that in fact most get little to anything and the ones who do get something’s had to and have to continually fight and work to keep getting anything. All while living in a constant state of stress and trauma.

The fact is, and this is a fact you can look at the numbers yourself, we spend [STREET] more money on the bureaucracy we require to deny people help than we spend on the help that we go to great lengths to make it as difficult and shameful as we possibly can make it to get. 

That woman who had that [TIME] long phone interview with me, who I’m sure is a good and kind person trying to survive like the rest of us, that woman was getting payed. And as an employee of the city and county of [ORGANIZATION] was likely making near 6 figures if not in fact 6 figures. And we as a society payed her that sum on [LOCATION] to find a reason to deny a homeless person, sober, working and struggling, we denied a homeless person food.

So, when you say you used to do what you could to help people, besides the tax dollars that are spent “helping” in the [STREET] I described above, what exactly was that help? You’d occasionally give some coins to someone to leave you alone? You’d occasionally decide not to call the police on someone who other than being unsightly was causing no other real harm or disturbance.

Because call me crazy, but I’m maybe a little suspicious of the guy saying he’d happily look the other [STREET] if the city decided to “crack some heads”  that maybe just maybe you in fact have never really been much help to the people you’re here advocating state violence against so casually and brazenly.

Something tells me you likely would do more for a stray dog then to address in any helpful or constructive [STREET] the human misery we all have to see everyday and that pieces of shit who sound an awful lot like you do do everything in their power to undermine and put requirements on which end up increasing the costs to all of our tax dollars, not just you but all the people who actually give a damn about other human beings want actually spent on just helping people the fuck out when they’re in a tight spot.

Don’t bother with any of the usual “I’m glad to hear your doing better” or any of that crap because i already know what you think about me because of it and i guarantee you I know who you think is to blame for me being in that circumstance and I’m tired of hearing fake niceties by people who are so morally bankrupt that i already know that the time I took here to ask a basic fucking question and safeguard it from the usual bad faith horseshit that’s always employed to side step these things is almost for sure just a waste of my fucking time and effort because your not gonna hear a god damn word of what I have to say. Or you’ll call me a liar maybe or find some other bad faith misdirect or just simply resort to ad hominem or some other logical fallacy bullshit to muddy my points and force me to waste even more time debating someone who doesn’t actually have any intention of fixing anything or helping anyone and would rather see  “heads cracking”.

Cause that’s how you solve your problems in life.

### Analysis:

**Comment Type:**
- **Express Their Opinion:** The commenter clearly states their belief that homeless individuals should be allowed to engage in risky behaviors.

- **Societal Critique:** The comment critiques societal attitudes towards homelessness by suggesting that being homeless might have some positive effects, which is a form of societal critique.

**Response Category:**
- **None:** The comment does not propose any specific solutions or interventions.

**Perception Type:**
- **Harmful Generalization:** The comment implies that being homeless can somehow improve cognitive function, which is a harmful generalization.
- **Deserving/Undeserving:** While not explicitly stated, there is an underlying judgment about who deserves help, as the comment suggests that homeless individuals should be allowed to take risks without intervention.

**Racist:**
- **No:** There is no explicit or implicit racial bias in the comment. However, the language used (""unsheltered,"" ""homies"") is derogatory and could be considered insensitive, but it does not specifically target a particular race.

"The taxes I pay could easily provide them and barely scratch the fiscal budget. But since they don't, I am also a serial $20 [PERSON]. That's what I would say had you not just used the most tired, unoriginal cop-out that people who want to shirk responsibility *love* to throw around. 

There's no two ways about it. These people are lacking resources, we have *plenty* of resources, but poor government planning, spending, and regulation, combined with people who don't see the homeless as humans and simply want to kick them out, are keeping the resouces out of their hands. 

You know how when you live in a society, it's everyone's responsibility to pay taxes so we can have roads and schools? Well, as society is made up of humans and humans can't really do much without each others' help, it's also your responsibility to take care of each other. Look at the homeless people in your neighborhood. They are your neighbors whether they sleep in a house or a tent. They are neglected and abused, and the problems that you face because of their existence ([ORGANIZATION] fires) could easily be solved if society just offered a *little* bit more support.",portland,"provide a fact or claim, express their opinion, societal critique","government critique, societal critique",solutions/interventions,"[harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]

"[ORGANIZATION] has universal healthcare that includes substance abuse and mental heathcare. The [PERSON] does not. 

Housing first in the [PERSON] works great for someone that is down on their luck, someone living in their car or couch surfing for [ORGANIZATION]. It can get otherwise ok people back on their feet and back into a job. These are the invisible homeless that are not the problem we see on the streets. These are not the people that [ORGANIZATION] is picking up literal tons of garbage after, these are not the drug users leaving needles in children's playgrounds. 

Housing first will not work with the chronic homeless without massive investments in drug programs and mental healthcare. The only change would be instead of a tent bike chop shop and drug den, it will be a tax payer subsidized apartment based bike chop shop and drug den. 

The very people that are the problem we see on the streets are still going to be a problem, they will just be a problem that is also contributing to the housing shortage. The only solution are mental hospitals where these people can be forced to receive the care they need. And as they get better they can be given more freedom and perhaps even jobs at the hospital where they can learn the skills to enter the public again.

"I'm from [ORGANIZATION] and I have to say there is really a huge disparity between homelessness on [ORGANIZATION] vs [LOCATION], particularly concerning the behaviors of these communities. Even in these major cities like [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], homelessness is not visibly as bad as it is in GPE2 — the homeless camps are so pervasive here, it's honestly quite shocking. Even in the [PERSON], I was alarmed at how many people I saw sleeping on sidewalks, in entryways, on the stoops of churches, etc. There are syringes and human feces everywhere. You just don't see this on [ORGANIZATION]. Plus, many people in the homeless community in this area are rather aggressive and intimidating, whereas in places like [ORGANIZATION]/[PERSON]/etc, they essentially just hold up signs and keep to themselves. 

I understand all of the facets that make GPE2 so attractive to those that are struggling with homelessness — mild climate, generous citizens, enabling government — but to compare the homeless communities of the LOC2 to those of the east is like comparing apples to oranges.

">""increased law enforcement"" implies people want more cops.

>Actual responses in the article suggest people want increased enforcement of laws.

How has this become the takeaway for people from this article? It's hardly the main point.

First of all, we need both - the cops we have need to do a better job of enforcing the laws, and we need more cops to cover more areas, more consistently, and to make sure there is sufficient availability for them to respond whenever a call for assistance comes in, even if it's not an immediate emergency. 

But the real issue here is something else entirely - that by a clear majority, people in this city are sick and tired of people simply being allowed to do whatever they want, wherever they want, without consequence. Not because they're not compassionate, not because they don't understand that many people who are homeless truly got there through no fault of their own or that most of us could relatively easily end up in the same situation, but because they realize that for those that struggle the most to make responsible choices, an overall approach that prioritizes permissiveness and enabling is the worst possible ""solution"" - for them and for the rest of us.

"It took no effort.  There are literally dozens of them. It's like our society is built to support and maintain a homeless population.  

Having a society that prioritizes being able to keep homeless people, homeless and happy, is not good for society.

">  I have no [STREET], beyond actually buying them the food, to guarantee my money is going to something of merit, so if I'm feeling generous, I'm feeling generous.

I forget how the bit goes, but I think it was [ORGANIZATION] that talked about this. And how some people get holier than thou about what a beggar might use the money for, but if you're homeless you would probably need a drink or drugs too. I'm butchering this. 

But I'm with you. Save your story. I'm either going to give you some change, or I'm not. I don't believe anything the panhandlers say, outside of the very likely possibility they've fallen on hard times (be they self inflicted or happenstance), and I'm not going to judge what you need the money for because I don't care. Just don't waste my time. Ask, respect the ""don't got it"" (I usually don't carry money) or get the change and keep it moving.

"This is a good point. I'm not sure if you're using this as an argument that people WANT segregation, or if you're just pointing out something you've seen, but the idea of gentrification brings attention to how out-of-balance things are. 

Gentrification is fucking awesome to people who own property, right? Like - if I bought a home for $40k and suddenly that neighborhood became the [STREET] to be, I'd be pumped to earn over 1000% on my investment over [ORGANIZATION]. 

But let's face it: **Gentrification is happening in places where the people living there do NOT own property.** They're tenants renting someone else's property. The ""kind"" landlords will raise rent to merely catch up with tax assessments and basic inflation, the rest of them will go ""the market value has changed"" (I put ""kind"" in quotes because very, very, very few landlords are anything but exploitative). 

***

So when we look at answering questions about systemic racism and living/property costs and wealth, a few things come up:

- Generational wealth is a concept that has positively impacted whites at a higher rate than [ORGANIZATION]. Everything from slavery to [ORGANIZATION] to redlining so every other flavor of systemic racism, the privilege of building and passing on generational wealth isn't afforded to many [ORGANIZATION]. Escaping the poverty loop is hard enough - and when you don't have generational wealth to build/pass on, you're stuck renting and hoping you don't get gentrified out of your living situation.
 - With no generational wealth, you greatly reduce the likelihood that the affected person can purchase a home
 - YES - white people deal with this too, albeit on a less-proportional level, and without the many other roadblocks. It needs to be understood that certain measures that may benefit [ORGANIZATION] may benefit whites in this same position...
- Accessibility to homes for those who might actually be in a position to purchase is waning. If you're [ORGANIZATION] from the east side and you want to remain in the community you grew up in, you might be looking at the east side. You might find something that's within your price range. You might also learn that your home's value may not appreciate faster than the rate of inflation because of where you are.
 - ""Crime!"" some of the neolibs and conservatives will cry. ""It's that [STREET] because of crime! Fix the crime and values will go up!"" Perhaps - but tell me how much that value actually goes up when the sounds of the 33 drown out your backyard [ORGANIZATION].
 - Hidden barriers. Aside from the pseudo-redlining that still happens among [ORGANIZATION], those $40,000 homes on the east side often require additional money to make them comfortably habitable. 
- NIMBY will always be a huge roadblock. Every time anyone ever mentions ""affordable housing"" - whether it's an income-based apartment complex or some allocation for some affordable path to home ownership, people make a stink. They will fight for ""those people"" to go back to to the [STREET] they belong and then use every dog whistle, holier-than-thou argument, and sob story about how the safety of their neighborhood is at risk.",buffalo,"provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion","government critique, societal critique",,"[harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]

"[ORGANIZATION] isn't as cheap for housing as people say. Apparently they haven't rented an apartment or room in [ORGANIZATION] or FAC0 in awhile. If they did they would know at those prices you usually only get a craphole.

Jobs here are great if you know people, if you social network you can make money in this town. If you are secluded and keep to yourself chances are you will only make min wage or just above.

There is a huge income disparity in ORGANIZATION.
I have found myself homeless here twice in [ORGANIZATION]. 

Once because of a job that closed (FAC1). Another time because I rented one of those *reasonably* priced apartments and dealt with a crazy landlord who would often come into my apartment. Sometimes when I was home, others when I was not home. That's just the start of it.

(Disclaimer: Being white and educated doesn't mean you aren't poor, a lot of people are educated here and job competition is vicious.)
I am white.
I have a DATE1 degree.
I do smoke pot, so that has definitely been a huge obstacle for me to overcome in regards to professional jobs.
But other than that I do not drink, take pills or other drugs.

So other than that, [ORGANIZATION] can be a great city to live in.
But the downsides are the nepotism, cold, income disparity, high rental prices, lack of reasonable bus system(that arrives on time or to the suburbs), [ORGANIZATION] collar/non-union).

Oh, and if you have any issues with credit good luck renting anywhere corporate. I was a unlucky individual with a awesome mother who used my info for utilities and other bills that makes renting that [STREET] near impossible. 

I'm not knocking [ORGANIZATION], but it has some serious issues and I just wanted to offer an alternative perspective from my lifelong episode of poverty and snow.

GL and Welcome to [ORGANIZATION].

"And they're asking people to donate food, clothing, and baby supplies -- not tents. As a lifelong democrat, no I am not universally opposed to social programs.

The reality is that the [ORGANIZATION] could donate the tent and camping supplies to a local nonprofit that could make good use of it. This is not as flashy or righteous as giving it to LGBTQ homeless people. The best outcome is someone pops a tent on the sidewalk, neighbors and local businesses call police immediately because encampments are not normalized here, and the tent is thrown in the trash. Worst outcome is someone pops the tent on private property and they are verbally/physically threatened before their tent is thrown away.

You can empathize with the homeless and gladly pay taxes to support people. You don't have to allow encampments to spring up in public places. You let that fester long enough under good intentions and you turn into [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON]. Look up the [ORGANIZATION] long skirmishes between police and activists over clearing encampments in FAC0 in [PERSON].

"DATE0 has almost 0 relevance to this conversation; cost of living is astronomically higher, while real wages have been stagnant for most of DATE1 DATE2. The housing crisis is an *affordability* crisis, and increasing supply across the board is a strategy to solve it.

Not everywhere needs to have middle density housing options, but you also don't want to completely suburbanize parts of [ORGANIZATION] with single-family homes, especially when it means higher utility costs and greenhouse gas emissions per capita. 

I'd also push back on the idea there was no housing crisis in [LOCATION], since urban renewal efforts targeting ""overcrowded"" black neighborhoods began soon after WWII, as black renters were not allowed in many ""higher end"" (white) neighborhoods. So an actually colorblind housing market might have seen higher demand for density outside of downtown if black urbanites could choose where they were able to build their lives.",buffalo,"provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion","government critique, societal critique",solutions/interventions,"harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]

Reasoning: The phrase ""beggars being choosers"" is often used to imply that homeless individuals have choices and can refuse assistance if they don't want it. This can be seen as a harmful generalization because it may overlook the complex circumstances that lead people to become homeless and suggests that those experiencing homelessness are making conscious decisions rather than facing difficult realities. However, there is no explicit or implicit racial bias in this statement.

"Someone mentioned gas stations, and I second that advice.

I have several friends whi are mangers at different [ORGANIZATION] gas stations and give homeless regulars  a ""job"" which is really just taking out the garbage and keeping the outside of the store clean in exchange for hot food that they are going to toss anyway, and even water and coffee. As long as they don't scare the customers away by hanging out/sleeping/begging on the premises, it works out well.

One of them had a woman who was outside of his store for [ORGANIZATION], rain or shine, in heat or cold. Her son was in prison, and she was trying to raise money to get an apartment for herself and him so that he would have a [STREET] to go when he got out. She was very friendly and never asked anyone for money outright - just would give a friendly ""hi"" and have [DATE].And if people gave her money, she would thank them, and she saved every penny - never used any on herelf so my friend let her get water/food from inside. I would stop and chat with her sometimes, that's how I know why she was out there. My friend let her stay out there all the [STREET] until she had the money to get her own [STREET]. I remember the last time I saw her, she updated me and told me she had got a [STREET] and was now trying to find some cheap furniture. I haven't seen her out there since, so  I'm glad that she made it.

My other friend who manages another [ORGANIZATION], had a guy there who he exchanged food and drinks for cleaning up the outside of the property and emptying the trash.  That worked out well for [LOCATION]. I would see this guy there all the time and it worked out well for both of them until recently -  he had to finally kick the guy out because he started bringing his friends who were  addicts and they started building a makeshift house on the side of the building and were kind of creeping the customers out.

But yeah, if you go inside and talk to the managers of one of these gas stations, a lot of them will work something out  with you.",elpaso,"provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions",,solutions/interventions,"personal interaction, harmful generalization]

This comment highlights both an observation from personal experience and an opinion regarding urban planning and zoning regulations, while also touching upon societal critiques concerning public health and residential quality of life. There's no indication of harmful generalizations specifically targeting race, but there is a perception of opposition to having homeless camps near residential areas. The concern seems to stem from broader societal values around cleanliness and safety rather than racial biases.
