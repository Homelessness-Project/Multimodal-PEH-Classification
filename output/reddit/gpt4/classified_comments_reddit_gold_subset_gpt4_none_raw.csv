Critique Category: government critique  
Response Category: [none]  
Perception Type: [none]  
racist: No  
Reasoning: The commenter uses a rhetorical question to challenge an implication about police behavior, then asserts as a fact that police do not beat panhandlers. This expresses their opinion and critiques the idea that local government (police) are abusive. There is no discussion of solutions, personal experience, or racial bias."
"If the city did not want this, they would not have dedicated half of the downtown area to homeless shelters.

Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [not in my backyard, societal critique]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter claims the city has dedicated half of downtown to homeless shelters (fact/claim/observation) and expresses a negative opinion about this decision and the motivations behind it. There is criticism of both government action (""the city did not want this"") and societal attitudes (""narcissistically institutionalizing compassion,"" ""self congratulatory...galas""). The tone suggests opposition to local homelessness developments (not in my backyard). There is no racial bias present."
"I know the corner of  [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] is one of the corners this guy apparently has people 'working.' The corner is always covered and it seems to rotate through a few of the same individuals, almost as if the are on shifts. I haven't heard much more than that, but I have heard the same thing from various people who work with homeless and/or addicts. I don't personally provide direct services or work with clients anymore so I haven't heard it myself but I trust those I have heard it from. Some were talking about trying to alert media or police to it but not sure that anyone has enough information to work with.

Response Category: []  
Perception Type: [personal interaction, deserving/undeserving]

Reasoning: The commenter shares their own observation about a specific corner being regularly occupied by the same individuals, suggesting a possible organized effort (""on shifts""). They reference what others (who work with homeless/addicts) have said, expressing others' opinions and claims. The mention of alerting media or police implies a judgment about the legitimacy or deservingness of those panhandling, but does not directly critique government, society, or money allocation, nor does it propose solutions. There is no racial bias present."
"Not a big surprise?

There is not a lack of low paying jobs here. The top needs of the panhandlers is usually mental care, which we as a society really suck at providing. Giving someone with a substance abuse problem or a mental disorder a trashbag and $10 an hour to pick up trash isn't going to do a lot.",southbend,"Comment Type: [ask a rhetorical question, provide a fact or claim, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The comment opens with a rhetorical question (""Not a big surprise?"") and claims there are plenty of low-paying jobs, suggesting the issue is not job availability but mental health care. The speaker critiques society's failure to provide adequate mental health support, which is a societal critique. The statement about panhandlers' ""top needs"" generalizes about people experiencing homelessness and implies some are less deserving of simple work-based solutions, fitting both harmful generalization and deserving/undeserving. There is no racial bias present."
"Good call [ORGANIZATION]. Many, not all, of the panhandlers don't want a job. A great deal of them are former residents of FAC0 in town. They are usually out there begging for money to pay for their addiction and put money in their dealers hand.

I believe a better option is to take any money that could have gone to this and continue to provide low cost housing for the truly homeless. Couple that with finding a [STREET] to get more mental health facilities in town would go a longer [STREET] than jobs for these people.",southbend,"Comment Type: [express their opinion, provide a fact or claim, provide an observation]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion about panhandlers, claims many are addicted and not seeking jobs, and observes their behavior. They critique how money is allocated, suggesting it should go to housing and mental health rather than job programs, and imply some homeless are more ""deserving"" of help than others. The statement generalizes negatively about panhandlers but does not contain racial bias."

Response Category: solutions/interventions  
Perception Type: deserving/undeserving  
racist: No  
Reasoning: The commenter claims that the organization supports the poor and houseless, and expresses the opinion that they would get aid to someone in need. This implies a solution/intervention (the organization's work) and a judgment about deservingness (aid going to those who ""need it""). There is no critique, personal interaction, media reference, or racial bias present."
"I experience the same comments with non-benders in my car. It's tough because we want [ORGANIZATION] to be better, and there's been large improvements. But there is still a [ORGANIZATION] of work to be done. At this point, I feel as if the homeless issue is starting to hold back development and other progress in the city, mainly downtown. I can't stress enough how delicate and sensitive of an issue this is for [ORGANIZATION]. Agree or not, we are a liberal city, with quite a few Democrats in charge. The bread of butter of Democrats is poor relief. Is the current situation a result of the current (local) administration/leaders? I mean, this doesn't happen overnight and is really a product of issues that effect the entire [PERSON] (is [ORGANIZATION] the only or select few with this problem? No). But here we are, with this issue in our laps. It doesn't matter so much as to how they got here. The real focus needs to be how to get them back onto their feet and self sufficient. There has been proven success with the housing first model. We don't have the capital to overnight the project and get results right away, so we are left in a holding pattern waiting for the first units to come online and gather data on how that works for us. 

I think this issue could actually be a fantastic opportunity for [ORGANIZATION] to step in. They have some of the brightest individuals there, that could use their resesrch expertise, and other knowledge to come with up with a collaborative approach with the City of [ORGANIZATION] to help tackle this problem the right [STREET]. I've always thought [ORGANIZATION] should be a little more involved with [ORGANIZATION], and I don't see why this issue would be any different. ORG2 benefits from a better [ORGANIZATION].

Reasoning: The commenter shares personal observations about the impact of homelessness on city development and expresses opinions about the city's political leadership and their responsibility. They provide claims about the effectiveness of the housing first model and discuss the allocation of resources and the need for more involvement from a local organization. They critique both government and societal responses, and discuss the challenge of resource allocation.

Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]

Reasoning: The commenter refers to homeless people as ""bums,"" which is a harmful generalization and implies a negative stereotype. They claim that the presence of homeless people is due to the services offered, which is both an observation and a claim. There is a critique of societal approaches to homelessness (suggesting services attract homelessness) and an implicit critique of how resources are allocated. No explicit racial bias is present. No solutions or interventions are discussed."
"It's because you're just some [ORGANIZATION] who posted ""SB Cops Murdered a [DATE] [PERSON]"" along with a link to a local TV news story that doesn't at all support that inflammatory claim at this point.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion about the original poster's behavior, observes that the claim is not supported by the linked news story, and claims the post is inflammatory. The critique is directed at the way information is presented and consumed in society, particularly regarding sensationalism and credibility. The mention of a news story and its mismatch with the claim points to media portrayal. There is no discussion of race or racial bias."
It’s either build the center and have all of the people you’re so worried about in one [STREET] or have them out on the streets not getting the mental help they need. The people you’re afraid of are someone’s daughter/son/mother/father. Every time I see someone saying this is a bad idea I see someone who has not a lick of common sense.

Perception Type: [not in my backyard, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The comment uses a rhetorical question to challenge opposition to building a center for homeless people, expresses the speaker's opinion about the lack of common sense in opponents, and references others' opinions (those who oppose the center). It critiques societal attitudes toward homelessness, particularly the ""not in my backyard"" mentality and the tendency to view homeless people as undeserving or as a problem. The mention of building a center and providing mental help references a solution/intervention. There is no racial bias present."
"There are several reasons that someone couldn't stay at center for the homeless but could be at [ORGANIZATION].
Some are innocuous, such for example, [ORGANIZATION] doesn't allow pets, but [ORGANIZATION] does. [ORGANIZATION] is sex segregated so couples can't stay there together, but they can at [ORGANIZATION]. 

But the other big distinction is that [ORGANIZATION] isn't a low barrier shelter, so they have a strick drugs and alcohol policy, which [ORGANIZATION] does not. I'm pretty sure that [ORGANIZATION] also requires residents to participate in mental health and job counseling, which [ORGANIZATION] for now does not.",southbend,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation]

Reasoning: The commenter provides factual statements and observations about the differences between two organizations serving people experiencing homelessness (PEH), such as policies on pets, couples, substance use, and required participation in counseling. There is no critique of money, government, or society, nor are there solutions, personal experiences, or stereotypes. No racial bias is present."

Reasoning: The comment states that the organization is aware of the homeless population and describes a partnership to provide free meals, which is both a factual claim and an observation. It highlights a specific intervention (free meals), but does not critique money, government, or society, nor does it reference personal interaction, media, NIMBYism, generalizations, or deservingness.

"I just wanted to chime in that I think your question is so so so valid and I am glad you asked it. When you haven’t been around people experiencing active homelessness and potentially untreated mental health issues it can be scary at first bc let’s be real… all the unknown things and situations in our lives are scary for the most part- positive or negative. I am relieved to see all the posts on here educating and in support of giving humans a meal, electricity, and even a space to feel safe when they barely feel safe with their own thoughts. The library is doing a beautiful thing and if it truly bothers you that much that you refuse to go to the downtown location I think you really should just be grateful you have the option and resources to [STREET] 5 miles to the next library. And, I mean that genuinely.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their own supportive opinion about providing resources to people experiencing homelessness and references others’ educational posts. They provide an observation about fear of the unknown and a fact/claim about the library’s supportive actions. They mention their husband’s personal interaction with someone experiencing mental health issues and his subsequent decision, referencing both personal experience and others’ opinions. There is a subtle societal critique in encouraging gratitude for having options/resources and challenging the “not in my backyard” attitude. The comment supports interventions (meals, electricity, safe spaces) and frames people experiencing homelessness as deserving of help. No racial bias is present."

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion and makes an observation about the location of homeless services, suggesting it should be centrally located for better access and support. They critique the societal tendency to place such services far away, implying a ""not in my backyard"" attitude from others. They also propose a solution/intervention by suggesting a better location. There is no racial bias present."
"Yeah, anywhere a new [INSTITUTION] is built within the city it’s going to be near some residences and businesses, and until someone is willing to take a risk to change the situation by at least letting a new shelter try within walking distance of them nothing will improve.

Reasoning: The commenter claims that new shelters will always be near residences/businesses and expresses the opinion that improvement requires someone to take a risk by allowing a shelter nearby (fact/claim, opinion). They also express others' opinions by stating that many objectors would rather see homeless people imprisoned or dead than near their neighborhood (express others opinions). The critique is of societal attitudes (societal critique), and the mention of allowing a shelter is a solution/intervention. The ""not in my backyard"" attitude is referenced, as well as the idea that some people see the homeless as undeserving of help or even life. There is no racial bias present."

Reasoning: The commenter claims that a group has been advocating for the unhoused and expresses sadness about their shutdown, indicating an opinion. The mention of advocacy and forced shutdown implies a societal critique regarding support for the unhoused. The group’s advocacy is a form of intervention. The phrase ""small but mighty"" and sadness at their closure suggest the commenter sees the unhoused as deserving of help. There is no racial bias present."

"Hey neighbor, I live over here as well! 

I share a lot of your concerns, but we have to remember that this needs to go *somewhere*. Its probably going to have a negative impact wherever it goes, it just happens we drew the short straw this time. I already sent an email to [ORGANIZATION] (and I should probably send one to [PERSON] as well) requesting some more specifics on what the plan is to maintain the neighborhood. Id suggest you do the same. The more pressure, the better. When this happens, because it certainly sounds like its going to, we are going to have to try to make the most of it. We will have a vested interest in making sure the residents there succeed and receive the resources they are promised. We will also need to make sure we hold the city's feet to the fire to make sure they fulfill their promises to us and maintain our neighborhood. 

Thankfully this is a little different than a soup kitchen or shelter.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their own concerns and opinions about the homelessness development in their neighborhood, observes the likely negative impact, and claims the project is different from a soup kitchen or shelter. They critique the city/government by emphasizing the need to hold officials accountable and ensure promises are kept, and also touch on societal responsibility by acknowledging the need for the project to exist somewhere. They discuss interventions by suggesting community members pressure officials and support the success of the residents. The ""not in my backyard"" perception is present as they discuss the impact on their own neighborhood and the sense of having ""drawn the short straw.""

"There have been polls taken from people living under the viaduct, around downtown, etc. in [ORGANIZATION] showing that they won’t accept city help, either because they prefer living homeless or don’t trust the government, or both.

Mayor [PERSON] would even go to the homeless encampments In Person and talk to those living there - even with personal persuasion, he couldn’t get people to not want to live under that viaduct.

They express their opinion that helping is a “lost cause” and reference others’ opinions (the homeless not trusting government).

"The meeting was a great showing of varying community opinion. Went from [TIME].

\- PERSON0 got truly irate

\- PERSON1 (mayors office) got called out for unintentionally lying and providing partial information [ORGANIZATION] night to council. [TIME] before the meeting too.

\- The main guy from [ORGANIZATION] said FAC0 started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after [TIME] when there is no presence on site. Some lady from [ORGANIZATION] who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to [LOCATION] and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- [ORGANIZATION] got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until [TIME]) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- [ORGANIZATION] and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- PERSON2 of [ORGANIZATION] berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from ORG2 essentially said the same thing. [ORGANIZATION] also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes [TIME] the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which [ORGANIZATION] said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with [ORGANIZATION] apologized because they were voting against.

\- PERSON4 also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly [ORGANIZATION] employees, and people like PERSON4 who only took up [TIME] total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give [TIME] to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition [TIME]?

\- [ORGANIZATION] had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the [ORGANIZATION] project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the [STREET]. [ORGANIZATION] kept repeating they asked their consultant (DATE2) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as [ORGANIZATION] while giving numerous sites labels of [LOCATION]. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- PERSON6 tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter ([ORGANIZATION]) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""[INSTITUTION]"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. [ORGANIZATION] said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 [PERSON] meetings, 1 of which is attended. The [PERSON] barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in [ORGANIZATION] without a site in mind so then it became urgent in [LOCATION] to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around DATE4. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side?

It provides observations and claims about what happened, expresses the author's opinions (e.g., irritation, skepticism), and references the opinions of others (e.g., people from different backgrounds, council members, opposition). There is critique of how money is being allocated ($175,000 per unit, remediation costs), criticism of government and organizational transparency and process, and some societal critique regarding how opposition and support are handled. The mention of opposition to the project and concerns about location reflect ""not in my backyard"" attitudes, and there are hints of ""deserving/undeserving"" in the discussion of who should benefit from the housing. There is no explicit or implicit racial bias present; the mention of racial/ethnic backgrounds is descriptive, not prejudicial. No specific solutions or interventions are proposed in the comment."

There would be on site visits from [ORGANIZATION] (recovery coach) but for their caseworker it sounds like they would pick up individuals and bring them to [ORGANIZATION].

Reasoning: The commenter claims there are more than four homeless people in their area and observes that their city has fewer issues than others, particularly ""out West,"" where they state there are ""full encampments everywhere.""

"I’ve lived downtown for [ORGANIZATION] and see homeless people sleeping in my parking lot on benches, setting up tents by the river and sleeping, just trying to be comfortable somewhere. I think it is ridiculous to act like providing homeless people housing would somehow increase crime when we know that evidence shows providing stable living environments brings DOWN crime. I would much rather live next door to a housing facility for the homeless than continue to see people sleeping on the bare ground. The same people who complain about the amount of homeless people are the same ones who complain whenever the city does anything to try to assist them.

"Thanks for your thoughtful response. 

I'm curious how large complexes are more harmful? And I also thought [ORGANIZATION] doesn't allow visitors or drugs. Maybe a safe injection site is also needed so people aren't shooting up in people's yards. I think it was a little misguided that the director of [ORGANIZATION] said homelessness was done for with [ORGANIZATION] running. 

To the point of something outside the city, good luck getting the county to agree to that. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] hate homeless people to the point of calling them garbage. The county commissioners don't want to fund anything that isn't already a running program or a giant corporation trying to move in. [ORGANIZATION] didn't even pay attention to the meeting, just got the [INSTITUTION] to shut things down(there were clearly too many people, but that was an observation I had).

"I like some of his ideas but I have a better chance being a pro basketball player than [ORGANIZATION] does consolidating departments or initiatives with [PERSON]. Him thinking that's possible makes me question if he's just saying that to get away with the ""how will you pay for this"" question than it either shows willful misleading or not understanding the dynamic between the two cities.

He seems to be trying to be the best of both worlds and say ""hey if you like [ORGANIZATION] and where the city is going I'm your guy but also hey [ORGANIZATION] is overrated and the city needs a lot of work"" it's an interesting strategy. I think he actually has a more critical view of [ORGANIZATION] and the city government than he let's on (which there is nothing wrong with) that I wish he would just come out in the open and say so the debate could be better.

Edit - For example it's easy to say the city is ""screwing around"" with the homeless situation, but to not give what you would actually so different. The city had a decent homeless initiative that was stopped by residents in unison saying you're not putting transition centers in ""my neighborhood"". So how do you get past that? What is he going to do to fix the problem besides, say, not screwing around? Whatever that even means. Considering it's a top 3 initiative of his, he's provided no details whatsoever.

The mention of NIMBYism critiques societal attitudes. The comment references ""choosing"" homelessness due to habits, which implies a deserving/undeserving distinction and a harmful generalization about drug use among PEH.

"So, I've changed a lot on this one over time. I spent [ORGANIZATION] as an advocate working against chronic homelessness, have participated on some of the city's [LOCATION] on homelessness, etc, but I don't think the city, nor this take are being entirely generous.

1 - yes, housing first is scientifically the most effective model for caring for the homeless. It's math, not feelings. It [LOCATION] - but... housing first doesn't give free license to do housing first poorly. there are ways to do zero barrier in ways that are more harmful and less harmful.3 - less harmful = scattered site. less harmful = day shelter programming and a more controlled check in/check out process. more harmful = large complexes. more harmful (to the community) = no day programming, free roaming, full freedom, full visitation (allows for drug dealers)4 - Motels4Now has been good for the homeless, but harmful for many near it. It just has. Businesses have closed, people feel less safe, and it decreases the dignity and pride of the people near it (who - as those on the [ORGANIZATION] side - have already dealt with a lot of disinvestment). I'm not sure it's fair to help some people by harming some others, especially when it's just due to not being willing to produce the funding to do it in a [STREET] that is even more helpful and less harmful.I think at this point my preference would be something outside of city limits, on the edge of town where there's still zero restrictions on sobriety, but still a more programmatic or controlled environment. And let's pay for a shuttle that can connect people to the bus line. Surely a small shuttle bus and a full-time driver is within financial reason, given the total project will cost millions anyway.

I'm not saying my idea is the best one. But we at least have to have some compassion for the real expressed needs of neighbors and business owners without painting them out to be petty or greedy.

Reasoning: The commenter provides claims and observations about the situation (e.g., lack of license, driving to different locations), expresses their own opinion with sarcasm and skepticism, and references others' opinions (e.g., mocking the ""look at me"" attitude). The critique is aimed at societal attitudes, particularly the perceived tendency to victimize addicts and praise those helping them. The comment contains harmful generalizations about homeless people/addicts (""those addicts are always the victim"") and questions who deserves sympathy or help.

The language generalizes about ""drifters"" and ""con men,"" implying that some people involved in homelessness are undeserving or manipulative, which is a harmful generalization.

Reasoning: The commenter lists specific actions taken to help homeless people (facts/claims), observes the lack of resources and long waitlists, and expresses frustration (opinion). The rhetorical questions challenge the idea that there is sufficient help available. The critique targets the lack of funding and resources (money aid allocation), hints at government/systemic failures (government critique), and criticizes those who judge or criticize existing programs (societal critique). The mention of searching for help and direct knowledge suggests personal interaction. The tone implies frustration with those who question the deservingness of help or criticize helpers.

"Pretty strong rhetoric here. [ORGANIZATION] administers both homeless prevention assistance and housing assistance for thousands of people [ORGANIZATION]. And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. [ORGANIZATION] literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at [TIME] to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG2 does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

I'm very sorry to hear that you're having a hard time keeping up with building codes. I hope that you can make the adjustments required for you to continue helping people in a [STREET] that's safe, and I hope that you're able to continue to increase what you do for the community. I do understand that it's not an easy thing to have to deal with, but lashing out at the city is not the solution.

"Her live video [TIME] does some more name dropping, [ORGANIZATION] and the mayor were at the event she went to.  Then she talks about a doctor there who spoke, and this doctor also helps ‘her’ people get off heroin by giving them suboxone.

Reasoning: The commenter summarizes a live video where someone describes events and people involved in helping the homeless, including doctors prescribing suboxone and churches donating food. The comment provides observations and facts about aid distribution (e.g., food donations, suboxone prescription) and references others’ opinions and experiences (the speaker in the video). There is a critique of resource allocation, noting a significant difference in food donations between two locations. The perception is based on personal interaction (relaying direct experiences from the video) and includes a subtle deserving/undeserving element by distinguishing between who prescribes suboxone and who receives it.

"A lot of people commenting are assuming the people she's helping have a phone and can call for help themselves. Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss [PERSON]'s bc they know she has [LOCATION] and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break. 

I am not saying that there is or isn't a reason to be concerned, I don't know either [STREET], but some of the comments are petty [ORGANIZATION].

"[ORGANIZATION] (now called something else that I can’t remember): [PHONE]. 

There’s also the homeless hotline (based in [ORGANIZATION] human services): [PHONE] extension 5. 

Emergency housing in [ORGANIZATION] is damn near impossible to navigate and I’m sorry you’re experiencing it firsthand. Even to get on a waitlist, you’ll be waiting for an eternity. There’s a severe shortage of affordable and safe housing in the area. 

Unfortunately your best bet is to secure employment and find temporary housing at a hotel/motel and then securing your own housing.

Please excuse my sarcasm and my bad dry jokes my humor I love to go sense of humor and a bad bad joke set [ORGANIZATION] but I am indeed just trying to keep this light because I really don't know what the problem is I have lived in [ORGANIZATION] for [DATE] and I just recently heard about Miss [PERSON]'s and maybe [ORGANIZATION] and I haven't heard anything but very good things about the establishment and her in general but again I mentioned personal experiencing I don't have to go into detail cuz it doesn't really matter but I I was helped greatly by Miss [PERSON] and never having met her in my entire life nor had she met me and I know that putting this down here but I bet you're wrong and I'm pretty transparent if anybody wants to know they can ask very easy to send somebody in private message but you know I'm not going to throw it out there it doesn't matter if I'm just going to say it's not I'm guessing it's probably not what you think unless you somehow or never mind whoever you I'm speaking of generally like whoever it is that has these issues and problems against Miss [PERSON] personally or Miss [PERSON]'s and in general I'm just curious I'd like to know why you taking such an interest in doing this and I wonder if it was you that had something to do with shut getting there needle exchange and shut down or any of the other things that help people that aren't perfect or that do things that you don't like I don't know I think that what my problem is more than anything else doesn't matter who it is or where it is or who these people are who you are who any thing related to whatever it is take what is is it your job to do this I just am wondering like again I'm going to say I'm just so curious as to what made you dislike the [STREET] so much that you're going to sit there and you're going to as far as I know slender I don't know that any of this is true I'd like to see your proof but I guess again I don't know anything about this and I'm just my anger is in the fact of that it's things like this that have the world set to where it is right now thank God you can't quit feeling things for [PERSON]'s sake hey come leave people alone is what I mean keep feeling it's the one [STREET] or another about things you don't like maybe your life would be a little bit happier but definitely like my mom would say leave people the f alone right I say quit feeling others just say let you I also noticed that you put down all of those things that must have took some time to get all that information and everything I sure hope that you're right about all of them and I'll end right now because I'm getting so irritated and going on and thinking about this but I noticed there wasn't anything I put out as far as how many meals have been served how many homeless people have been housed how many people have gotten to go to rehabilitation services that otherwise wouldn't have .

Reasoning: The commenter asks both genuine and rhetorical questions about the motivations behind criticism of a person/organization helping homeless people and drug addicts. They provide personal observations and experiences, express their own opinions, and reference the opinions of others (e.g., ""I haven't heard anything but very good things""). The critique is aimed at societal attitudes—questioning why people oppose or criticize those helping marginalized groups, and highlighting the lack of recognition for positive outcomes (meals served, people housed, etc.). The response category is present as the commenter references interventions (needle exchange, meals, housing, rehab). The perception type includes personal interaction (the commenter was helped directly) and deserving/undeserving (challenging the idea that drug addicts or homeless people are undeserving of help). There is no racial bias present."
"I will try to save everyone [TIME] of their life by summarizing the Live video.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed a few complaints on her fb page.  First, she addressed the gal who expressed frustration of clothes, personal care bags, food, razors, feminine products being dumped around her home.  The woman asked miss [ORGANIZATION] volunteers to come pick it up since it’s a regular problem.  [ORGANIZATION] addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets [ORGANIZATION] while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.  That doesn’t happen anymore,  but instead it became the neighbors problem.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at [ORGANIZATION]’s a few times and was angry at how she wasn’t helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed it saying it’s because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers aren’t sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her [STREET] is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is [ORGANIZATION] register [ORGANIZATION] may turn out to be a blessing for her, per [ORGANIZATION] (not in those words).  She can’t comment on the article per the board, but so many people have offered support since the article so these things may get addressed by volunteers in the community.  I feel so bad for these businesses being sucked into this when the economy hasn’t been the best for all lines of business.  Do they know she raised $400k for a $175k building?  I also felt bad for the Mexican restaurant donating so many meals DATE2.  I hope the food goes to those that need it, but cash flow at restaurants has been tough since [PERSON] and inflation.

Reasoning: The commenter summarizes a live video, relaying both their own and others’ opinions and observations about the organization’s handling of aid, volunteer behavior, and community complaints. They reference facts/claims (e.g., money raised vs. building cost, volunteer sobriety, donation practices), express their own feelings (e.g., feeling bad for businesses), and share others’ complaints. There is critique of how money is spent and societal issues (e.g., neighbors now dealing with trash, businesses impacted). Solutions/interventions are discussed (e.g., need for more trash cans, volunteers picking up trash). The deserving/undeserving perception appears in the discussion of who receives aid and the implication that some may not be as deserving (e.g., the woman denied help due to her appearance, concerns about donations going to those in need). No racial bias is present."

Reasoning: The commenter observes and critiques the actions of a person (likely a service provider), implying they are not doing enough to help homeless individuals beyond minimal aid (""a couple of sleeping bags"").

"1) Its close to [ORGANIZATION]. I love that its really quick to jump on the highway and be there in [TIME] or so. housing is less expensive

2) I hate the crime and gang violence that spills out of the west side of [PERSON]. it also acts like a catch all for the riff raff coming out of [ORGANIZATION]. the homeless is a growing issue too. 

The roads are crap because you get the worst of [ORGANIZATION] being down well below 0 for [LOCATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] are well above the 90s for [LOCATION]. the springs and falls are nice but its [ORGANIZATION] of each. 

[PERSON] is also a highly industrial area, except that was [PERSON]. alot of empty rusted dilapidated buildings that hipsters start a business in for [PERSON] then go under.

this area is extremely blue collar, the only thing that they like to do is go to bars. Not really a music or art culture here. just bars. 

people here cant [STREET] worth a shit. guys in [ORGANIZATION] are still wearing skater shoes with chain wallets. Moms smoke in their cars with their babies listening to papa roach. 

since they passed a gambling law, there are slots on every corner and in every [STREET] imaginable. They also passed another granting [PERSON] to build a casino [PERSON] or DATE8. So the people that live paycheck to paycheck that already have problems can go to surrender what they have left. But the city gets a bit of the profit, which you'll never see get implemented to benifit you in any [STREET]

3) I wish [PERSON] had one [STREET] that wasnt constantly covered in trash.

4) I would vist the surrounding towns in [PERSON], or even GPE2. but each town will have its own challenges. like when a chemical tool plants explodes and burns for [ORGANIZATION]#x200B;

Final thoughts: You might need to reconsider what youre willing to sacrifice for what you hope to gain. The [ORGANIZATION] is just one big cornfield of poverty. Im personally biased in that I hope a nuclear bomb goes off in this city. I would say that maybe just rent for [LOCATION]0 to experience the seasons and they [STREET] people act like here. Sure we dont have [ORGANIZATION] like you do in [LOCATION], but we have plenty of suicidal alcoholic domestic abusers that fly their freak flag here. So its a trade off.

Reasoning: The commenter claims that homeless people need shelter and criticizes the attitude of only wanting to end homelessness locally, which is a societal critique and references the ""not in my backyard"" mentality. They rhetorically question the sincerity of wanting to end homelessness if it's only for one's own area.

There is no explicit or implicit racial bias present."
"The city has been practicing the [ORGANIZATION] program for [ORGANIZATION].  What housing first does is provide shelter first, and then addresses the person's other issues.  The city also put a lot of people up in rooms during [PERSON] because they got funding for it.  It makes no sense that [ORGANIZATION] would pay for people's rent. The city has been so successful with [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] is a model for other cities.  The city also collaborates with other agencies to reduce overlap and gaps.  However, the city employees can't post on social media about what they do.  [ORGANIZATION] rarely speaks of the work and programs of the city and other agencies.  

It isn't compassionate to supply people to live rough indefinitely, and put a strain on community spaces when bedding, tents, clothing, and food waste are dumped and abandoned buildings go up in flames.  It is reckless to give people hope that they can live sustainably with a cup of ramen, a few blankets and a tent in [LOCATION].  That is why no other agency in town provided materials to live outdoors, they provide shelter first.  However, the city can't force anyone to accept help, so there will always be un-sheltered people.

They provide a claim about someone being ""desperate"" and express their opinion by questioning the choice of seeking help in one place over another. The mention of ""guaranteed placement"" versus uncertainty implies a judgment about decision-making, which can relate to perceptions of deservingness.

"Most of those funds go to programs for housing and homeless prevention.They, for a while, also could go towards temporarily sheltering people. So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for [ORGANIZATION], or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for [LOCATION].  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in [STREET], and certain things that these funds simply can't help with. 

Then there's a couple programs that help people pay utility bills, but those are usually paid for with funds that are separate from what I was talking about before.",rockford,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion that prosecuting homeless people is inhumane and implies that this leads to negative outcomes (""terrible shit""), which is both an opinion and a claim. They critique the government's approach (using police to address homelessness) and also critique societal attitudes by suggesting the problem lies with those who blame homeless people.

Reasoning: The commenter claims that an organization closed a homeless center and redirected people elsewhere, which is both a factual claim and likely an opinion about the situation. This implicitly critiques the organization (possibly government or NGO) for their handling of resources and policy. There is no direct discussion of solutions, personal experience, media, stereotypes, or racial bias."
"I don’t have recorded numbers to report but I was a manager at [ORGANIZATION]. Had relationships with a handful of homeless people who also would say that people get stuck here.

In [ORGANIZATION] came this [STREET] as his brother had moved to [ORGANIZATION] and was sick. He bounced around the [ORGANIZATION] for a few [ORGANIZATION] eventually hitting [PERSON].  This was in [PERSON]. I met him in [ORGANIZATION] I believe. 

He told me that there were decent support structures around here if you weren’t a degenerate and he could always find enough work to get by. He didn’t plan on staying here but before he knew it 8 [ORGANIZATION] had passed. He was close enough to get down and see his brother fairly quickly when he wanted to and back.  He was getting older and this felt like a good spot.

Reasoning: The comment quotes a statement that refutes a rumor about homeless people arriving in ""busloads,"" instead claiming they are arriving gradually, as reported by those working with the unhoused. This provides a factual claim and references the opinions of others (those who work closely with the community). It addresses misconceptions likely spread by media or word-of-mouth, but does not critique money, government, or society, nor does it propose solutions. The focus on rumors and their correction relates to media portrayal. There is no racial bias present."

By the [STREET], most folks who are unhoused are not actually living on the streets or other public places.  Most are doubled-up with friends or family members, or living in motels/hotels.  Also, while we have resources available, we don’t have enough.

They express their opinion that ""magnet"" is not the right term. They critique the adequacy and allocation of resources (money aid allocation) and point out societal barriers (e.g., LGBTQ+ exclusion, family separation), which is a societal critique.

"Yeah, but specifically how? 

Tax rates for the wealthy are going down, not up. As you've seen in [ORGANIZATION] now, passing anything, even with democrats in power, is nearly impossible. Including tax hikes (fun fact: the bill being debated right now - is more than 25% tax cuts. As in the infrastructure bill is more than 25% tax cuts. And the Democrats are...in power, not the Republicans).

People always have simple answers to big problems, and these simple answers solve none of the problems. It is actually.... probably the saddest thing I've witnessed, in general over my life. 

We've said we would solve so much. Climate change, gun violence, equality, social mobility - and we've made zero progress on any of these. We've made negative progress, even. We can't even legalize marijuana at the federal level. 

Here's a simple solution to solving climate change; just do it. Just do it. Easy, right?

People on this subreddit keep asking the same questions, and providing the same simple answers. And yet they are amazed that they are unsatisfied with the results. Here's what the people asking these questions don't want to hear; invite the homeless in to your house. Or take your paycheck, and buy a house for the homeless person, or buy the homeless person a [ORGANIZATION] at a hotel. These are actual solutions that any of us can do. It just takes sacrifice from us. How many of us do you see making these sacrifices? None. 

We literally cannot even raise taxes. So it's just.... exhausting in a sense (trying to... demonstrate the gridlock, the partisanship, the need for solutions that can actually pass [PERSON]).

They also reference others' opinions by discussing what people on the subreddit say and do. The critique targets government inaction, societal attitudes toward big problems (including homelessness), and the allocation of money (taxes, aid).

For people experiencing homelessness, having an address and stability combats substance use but also provides them an actual chance to become employed.  A job is the silver bullet for many of the issues present; gives them a sense of community and also stable income. I think in [ORGANIZATION] ( lived there for [ORGANIZATION] including [LOCATION]) the issue isn’t physical housing. It’s the individuals living on the streets aren’t able to rent the open properties. By allowing/assisting them to get housed then they can focus on other goals. In [PERSON] and most major cities they utilize a housing-first approach, understanding that people are less likely to get sober or employed if they do not have stable housing.

"realistically speaking, how much does it cost to maintain a home [ORGANIZATION]? I am asking genuinely. I am a homeowner for [ORGANIZATION], and it seems to me that [ORGANIZATION], my maintenance costs are ***significantly*** lower than what my rent was prior to buying a larger house in a better neighborhood. Even if I ended up replacing every single appliance and fixture in my house over the course of DATE2, I don't think it would even come close to the [ORGANIZATION] cost of rent. I concede that I may be outside of the norm in terms of cost, hence the question. 

&#x200B;

>who's going to pay for it?

The community, but more to the point, land and housing costs are artificially high for reasons I stated in my original comment. Abolish (at the least) corporate landlords and see where the chips fall. I suspect the cost of living would be much better for everyone, myself a homeowner included. 

>Who's going to maintain it

The same ones that maintain it now - contractors. at best, landlords serve as a (very expensive) middleman between the tenet and the contractor. 

>Who's going to accept liability for the property?

The community. we pay more taxes keeping our homeless population alive than we would maintaining housing for them.

"I get what you’re saying, but free phones and phone service can be easy to obtain. The government cellphones don’t cost a thing. I see booths set up around my part of town (e. FAC0) that encourage people to come sign up for a free phone. 

And tbh the world of technology we live in now considers a cell phone to be a basic need, and rightfully so. There aren’t any more pay phones, or they are at least few and far between. Society is dependent on technology. Being homeless is hard enough. I despise that these asshats ruined the park for such a long time, but they are people. They are humans. They are important to someone, even if they aren’t even a blip on my radar, every person in that park has value and is special and important to someone. They deserve basic human kindness and it is society’s duty to care for and support each other. I am totally ok with my tax dollars being used to buy a phone and service for someone who can’t do it for themselves. Life is already hard enough. We can provide this support to have available basic human needs. 

I do get what you’re saying. I was jealous of the camp sites down there. They got better shit than I do. And I work my ass off to keep my head just above water. But it is a little bit on the ignorant side to just assume that a homeless person should not be entitled to basic needs. Or even something better. They have it rough enough, and maybe they don’t want to be pitied, maybe that’s condescending, but show some compassion. It goes a long [STREET]. :) 


Sorry for the long reply. It’s a lot of reading, but Im on my [ORGANIZATION] so I’m hyper, and I’m feeling emotional because of hormones.

Reasoning: The commenter asks both genuine and rhetorical questions about the mayor's responsibility and policies regarding homelessness, expressing skepticism and criticism toward the idea that the mayor is solely responsible. They also express their opinion by calling someone a ""nut bag"" and reference others' fears (""Are you scared of tents?""). The critique is directed at government responsibility and societal attitudes toward homelessness. The ""not in my backyard"" and ""harmful generalization"" categories are touched upon by referencing fear of tents and the suggestion of extreme solutions. There is no racial bias present."

Reasoning: The commenter provides a claim about long waitlists, expresses their opinion that the ""homeless don't want to be housed"" is a myth, and references the opinions of others who perpetuate this myth. The critique targets societal attitudes that shift blame onto the vulnerable rather than those in power. The perception type addresses the deserving/undeserving narrative by challenging the idea that homeless people are homeless by choice. There is no racial bias present."

Reasoning: The commenter asks a genuine question about the logic of license fees and affordable housing, provides a claim about small landlords' margins, and expresses their opinion on what solutions should focus on. The critique is about how financial mechanisms (fees) affect housing affordability, which falls under money aid allocation. They discuss potential solutions (adjusting fees to lower rent).

Reasoning: The commenter claims that bussing away homeless people is the most economically feasible solution (fact/claim, opinion), observes local government actions to remove camps (observation, personal interaction), and expresses appreciation for aggressive clean-up approaches (opinion, not in my backyard). The mention of finite resources and economic feasibility relates to money aid allocation, while the focus on preventing the area from being seen as accommodating to the homeless reflects societal critique and NIMBY attitudes. No racial bias is present."

Reasoning: The commenter makes several claims about homelessness being a ""them"" problem and lists criminal behaviors, implying a harmful generalization about people experiencing homelessness (PEH). They express their opinion that most homeless people ""need to be institutionalized"" and are not ""down on their luck,"" which is a deserving/undeserving judgment. The mention of ""refugees from far-flung countries"" not being homeless could be interpreted as a subtle reference to outsiders, but there is no explicit racial bias present. The comment critiques changing societal attitudes toward homelessness and expresses opposition to the idea that homelessness could affect ""vulnerable working class folks,"" aligning with a not in my backyard perception. No solutions or interventions are discussed."

“The law, in its majestic equality, forbids both rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges”

The sex offender problem is sort of tied up in the rest of this. We (rightly) do not want people who prey on children living close to where children congregate- but then we don’t have anywhere else for those people to go. They wind up homeless, no fixed address, and then if they do reoffend it’s harder to find them.

There should be a monitored halfway house for those kinds of offenders- but that’s a small number of the total unhoused population.

"Thank you for your summary of why the two resolutions' differing origins matters so much, this is what I am hoping to raise awareness of the most.

[PERSON]'s thoughts on the people's resolution:

>“It resonated as a stand alone, attention seeking, self aggrandizement, document in my eyes, which actually ignored our current efforts, did not build upon or improve our existing efforts, was condescending toward staff’s actual hard work in this arena, and was disappointing…. an opportunity for a rather small group of individuals to sufficiently stack the deck to speak, with their preferred track force members in order to gain more influence than they currently possess.”

What I think was strange about [PERSON]'s version was that it over-emphasized the [ORGANIZATION]'s efforts on housing insecurity and homelessness. Those are important things that align with my personal values, but that's not what we're talking about. We need to increase housing supply and expedite its production so that people just have options of places to live. I believe we're making steady progress doing this like removing commercial parking requirements, creating pre-approved design plans for infill developments downtown, FAC0 improvement plan...but there are some critical approaches we have not addressed. They are local actions that impact housing supply and local prices:

* **Hire another planner or two** to work with landowners to rezone more properties to allow housing in more places (e.g. FAC0 improvement project that's underway or our [ORGANIZATION] in our [ORGANIZATION] Plan 2040 our city refuses to act on). 
* You know those brownstones in [ORGANIZATION]? Triple-deckers in [PERSON]? They are illegal to build in most of our city due to zoning. **Reform our development code.** I believe it's a problem that it's easier to build sprawling subdivisions, and harder to build compact and traditional living. We need to change the code from [ORGANIZATION] zoning to form-based zoning. [PERSON] and [PERSON] are addressing this with a world-renowned consultant right now. If [PERSON] chooses to fall behind those two cities in urban planning, it will be laughable. 
* **Reduce/reform parking minimums** for residential (maybe using overlay districts) and simultaneously invest in transit. [PERSON] is offering cities in [PERSON] a match for transit investment (design of bus stops) and the [ORGANIZATION] has not taken them up on it. 
* [ORGANIZATION] councilmembers: **Stop holding rezone requests hostage.** 

Personally, I'm mostly annoyed that it seems several councilmembers don't recognize that [PERSON] **has made great progress** ***and*** **can do more.** There IS work to be done ...do they see that? I'm concerned that they know, they just don't want it.

This is both a factual claim and an observation. It critiques how money is allocated (cost of policing/hospitalizing vs. housing) and discusses a solution/intervention (housing and services).

Reasoning: The commenter claims that public services have helped many unhoused families and elderly Asians, and observes an increase in families needing services due to the economy. They express the opinion that current street homeless are “free Americans” who refuse help due to conditions, implying a distinction between deserving and undeserving homeless. There is a societal critique in defending public services and pushing back against criticism. The comment references interventions (public services) as solutions. The statement about “free Americans” generalizes about those still on the street, which is a harmful generalization and ties into the deserving/undeserving perception. No explicit or implicit racial bias is present."
"Agreed.  Have lived here since [ORGANIZATION].

"I’m curious, what exactly did you do to help before? I ask because, as someone formerly homeless I literally had maybe a handful of people who actually offered any kind of material help and usually it really wasn’t much.

In fact, when I was denied [ORGANIZATION] benefits for the second time because I was foolish enough to mention during the phone interview, after all the paperwork I completed and having to wait [ORGANIZATION] for the opportunity to get  1 phone call I better not miss or have to start all over, that I mentioned I sometimes would prepare and have meals with my girlfriend. And I was denied because I refused to do as they ask and go to this woman, one of the few people who actually stood by me and saw me get out of that situation, my real guardian angel, that I felt it was inappropriate for me to then have to ask her for her [ORGANIZATION], every detail of her personal finances, ask for her college transcript, take all this very detailed personal information making her vulnerable to whoever had it and turn it over to the county and state just so I could get a couple hundred a month I could use and only use making sure I, at the very least, had food in my stomach.

When I was a homeless man, asking one of the very few programs that offer any kind of help or relief just for the help of food was denied that help. And to have that be the second time of paperwork and waiting and phone interviews and then waiting some more just to find out that our system denied a working homeless person who because of pride had put off even asking for help until I realized why not her help if it’s there. That’s when I realized it actually wasn’t there.

People talk a lot about “all the things the homeless get” and as you said yourself they’re “freeloaders” without realizing that in fact most get little to anything and the ones who do get something’s had to and have to continually fight and work to keep getting anything. All while living in a constant state of stress and trauma.

The fact is, and this is a fact you can look at the numbers yourself, we spend [STREET] more money on the bureaucracy we require to deny people help than we spend on the help that we go to great lengths to make it as difficult and shameful as we possibly can make it to get. 

That woman who had that [TIME] long phone interview with me, who I’m sure is a good and kind person trying to survive like the rest of us, that woman was getting payed. And as an employee of the city and county of [ORGANIZATION] was likely making near 6 figures if not in fact 6 figures. And we as a society payed her that sum on [LOCATION] to find a reason to deny a homeless person, sober, working and struggling, we denied a homeless person food.

So, when you say you used to do what you could to help people, besides the tax dollars that are spent “helping” in the [STREET] I described above, what exactly was that help? You’d occasionally give some coins to someone to leave you alone? You’d occasionally decide not to call the police on someone who other than being unsightly was causing no other real harm or disturbance.

Because call me crazy, but I’m maybe a little suspicious of the guy saying he’d happily look the other [STREET] if the city decided to “crack some heads”  that maybe just maybe you in fact have never really been much help to the people you’re here advocating state violence against so casually and brazenly.

Something tells me you likely would do more for a stray dog then to address in any helpful or constructive [STREET] the human misery we all have to see everyday and that pieces of shit who sound an awful lot like you do do everything in their power to undermine and put requirements on which end up increasing the costs to all of our tax dollars, not just you but all the people who actually give a damn about other human beings want actually spent on just helping people the fuck out when they’re in a tight spot.

Don’t bother with any of the usual “I’m glad to hear your doing better” or any of that crap because i already know what you think about me because of it and i guarantee you I know who you think is to blame for me being in that circumstance and I’m tired of hearing fake niceties by people who are so morally bankrupt that i already know that the time I took here to ask a basic fucking question and safeguard it from the usual bad faith horseshit that’s always employed to side step these things is almost for sure just a waste of my fucking time and effort because your not gonna hear a god damn word of what I have to say. Or you’ll call me a liar maybe or find some other bad faith misdirect or just simply resort to ad hominem or some other logical fallacy bullshit to muddy my points and force me to waste even more time debating someone who doesn’t actually have any intention of fixing anything or helping anyone and would rather see  “heads cracking”.

Cause that’s how you solve your problems in life.

The rhetorical question about federal employees is sarcastic, dismissing the idea that the people present are anything but homeless/drug users. There is critique of government (police inaction) and society (mocking calls for compassion).

"I'm from [ORGANIZATION] and I have to say there is really a huge disparity between homelessness on [ORGANIZATION] vs [LOCATION], particularly concerning the behaviors of these communities. Even in these major cities like [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], homelessness is not visibly as bad as it is in GPE2 — the homeless camps are so pervasive here, it's honestly quite shocking. Even in the [PERSON], I was alarmed at how many people I saw sleeping on sidewalks, in entryways, on the stoops of churches, etc. There are syringes and human feces everywhere. You just don't see this on [ORGANIZATION]. Plus, many people in the homeless community in this area are rather aggressive and intimidating, whereas in places like [ORGANIZATION]/[PERSON]/etc, they essentially just hold up signs and keep to themselves. 

I understand all of the facets that make GPE2 so attractive to those that are struggling with homelessness — mild climate, generous citizens, enabling government — but to compare the homeless communities of the LOC2 to those of the east is like comparing apples to oranges.

It provides claims about mental illness among homeless people and observations about drug use and economic hardship. The rhetorical question is used to emphasize the prevalence of mental illness.

">""increased law enforcement"" implies people want more cops.

>Actual responses in the article suggest people want increased enforcement of laws.

How has this become the takeaway for people from this article? It's hardly the main point.

First of all, we need both - the cops we have need to do a better job of enforcing the laws, and we need more cops to cover more areas, more consistently, and to make sure there is sufficient availability for them to respond whenever a call for assistance comes in, even if it's not an immediate emergency. 

But the real issue here is something else entirely - that by a clear majority, people in this city are sick and tired of people simply being allowed to do whatever they want, wherever they want, without consequence. Not because they're not compassionate, not because they don't understand that many people who are homeless truly got there through no fault of their own or that most of us could relatively easily end up in the same situation, but because they realize that for those that struggle the most to make responsible choices, an overall approach that prioritizes permissiveness and enabling is the worst possible ""solution"" - for them and for the rest of us. 

Speaking from personal experience here - the last thing a person needs when they are finding it hard to make good choices is for someone to make it easier to make bad ones.",portland,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions]

Reasoning: The comment contains a rhetorical question about the origins of mental illness among homeless people and claims that most are ""crazy junkies"" rather than ""truly mentally ill,"" expressing the opinion that there is a significant difference between those born with mental illness and those who became mentally ill due to drug use. This introduces a harmful generalization and a deserving/undeserving distinction. The critique is societal, focusing on perceptions of homelessness and mental illness.

To now learn that family members staged this brutal killing is beyond belief and represents a double tragedy. They were responsible for taking [ORGANIZATION]'s life with unconscionable cruelty, and contrived to do so in our city under the guise of random violence, exploiting the legitimate fears of our residents.

Reasoning: The comment compiles news headlines and an official statement about a murder case initially blamed on a panhandler (implying a person experiencing homelessness), but later revealed to be staged by family members.

"I feel like this housing trust is a bit ridiculous.  We already fund a ton of public housing in this city and rents in this city are already some of the cheapest on [LOCATION].   Things like this also often spend a ton of money to help relatively few people.

A great analogy- Think about who buys new cars versus used cars. It's not all that different. Yet, as [ORGANIZATION] points out, ""There's no outcry about [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable car crisis""—because [ORGANIZATION] has plenty of affordable cars, just not affordable brand new cars.

"This is a good point. I'm not sure if you're using this as an argument that people WANT segregation, or if you're just pointing out something you've seen, but the idea of gentrification brings attention to how out-of-balance things are. 

Gentrification is fucking awesome to people who own property, right? Like - if I bought a home for $40k and suddenly that neighborhood became the [STREET] to be, I'd be pumped to earn over 1000% on my investment over [ORGANIZATION]. 

But let's face it: **Gentrification is happening in places where the people living there do NOT own property.** They're tenants renting someone else's property. The ""kind"" landlords will raise rent to merely catch up with tax assessments and basic inflation, the rest of them will go ""the market value has changed"" (I put ""kind"" in quotes because very, very, very few landlords are anything but exploitative). 

***

So when we look at answering questions about systemic racism and living/property costs and wealth, a few things come up:

- Generational wealth is a concept that has positively impacted whites at a higher rate than [ORGANIZATION]. Everything from slavery to [ORGANIZATION] to redlining so every other flavor of systemic racism, the privilege of building and passing on generational wealth isn't afforded to many [ORGANIZATION]. Escaping the poverty loop is hard enough - and when you don't have generational wealth to build/pass on, you're stuck renting and hoping you don't get gentrified out of your living situation.
 - With no generational wealth, you greatly reduce the likelihood that the affected person can purchase a home
 - YES - white people deal with this too, albeit on a less-proportional level, and without the many other roadblocks. It needs to be understood that certain measures that may benefit [ORGANIZATION] may benefit whites in this same position...
- Accessibility to homes for those who might actually be in a position to purchase is waning. If you're [ORGANIZATION] from the east side and you want to remain in the community you grew up in, you might be looking at the east side. You might find something that's within your price range. You might also learn that your home's value may not appreciate faster than the rate of inflation because of where you are.
 - ""Crime!"" some of the neolibs and conservatives will cry. ""It's that [STREET] because of crime! Fix the crime and values will go up!"" Perhaps - but tell me how much that value actually goes up when the sounds of the 33 drown out your backyard [ORGANIZATION].
 - Hidden barriers. Aside from the pseudo-redlining that still happens among [ORGANIZATION], those $40,000 homes on the east side often require additional money to make them comfortably habitable. 
- NIMBY will always be a huge roadblock. Every time anyone ever mentions ""affordable housing"" - whether it's an income-based apartment complex or some allocation for some affordable path to home ownership, people make a stink. They will fight for ""those people"" to go back to to the [STREET] they belong and then use every dog whistle, holier-than-thou argument, and sob story about how the safety of their neighborhood is at risk.",buffalo,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions, ask a rhetorical question]

Reasoning: The commenter provides facts and observations about gentrification, generational wealth, and systemic racism, while also expressing their own opinions and referencing the opinions of others (e.g., landlords, neolibs, conservatives, NIMBYs). They ask rhetorical questions to make points about property value and crime. The critique targets societal attitudes (NIMBYism, stereotypes), government/systemic issues (redlining, policy barriers), and resource allocation (affordable housing, generational wealth). The perception types include NIMBY attitudes, harmful generalizations (dog whistles, stereotypes about crime), and deserving/undeserving (who is seen as worthy of housing). There is no explicit or implicit racial bias from the commenter; rather, they critique systemic racism and its effects."

"[ORGANIZATION] isn't as cheap for housing as people say. Apparently they haven't rented an apartment or room in [ORGANIZATION] or FAC0 in awhile. If they did they would know at those prices you usually only get a craphole.

Jobs here are great if you know people, if you social network you can make money in this town. If you are secluded and keep to yourself chances are you will only make min wage or just above.

There is a huge income disparity in ORGANIZATION.
I have found myself homeless here twice in [ORGANIZATION]. 

Once because of a job that closed (FAC1). Another time because I rented one of those *reasonably* priced apartments and dealt with a crazy landlord who would often come into my apartment. Sometimes when I was home, others when I was not home. That's just the start of it.

(Disclaimer: Being white and educated doesn't mean you aren't poor, a lot of people are educated here and job competition is vicious.)
I am white.
I have a DATE1 degree.
I do smoke pot, so that has definitely been a huge obstacle for me to overcome in regards to professional jobs.
But other than that I do not drink, take pills or other drugs.

So other than that, [ORGANIZATION] can be a great city to live in.
But the downsides are the nepotism, cold, income disparity, high rental prices, lack of reasonable bus system(that arrives on time or to the suburbs), [ORGANIZATION] collar/non-union).

Oh, and if you have any issues with credit good luck renting anywhere corporate. I was a unlucky individual with a awesome mother who used my info for utilities and other bills that makes renting that [STREET] near impossible. 

I'm not knocking [ORGANIZATION], but it has some serious issues and I just wanted to offer an alternative perspective from my lifelong episode of poverty and snow.

"And they're asking people to donate food, clothing, and baby supplies -- not tents. As a lifelong democrat, no I am not universally opposed to social programs.

The reality is that the [ORGANIZATION] could donate the tent and camping supplies to a local nonprofit that could make good use of it. This is not as flashy or righteous as giving it to LGBTQ homeless people. The best outcome is someone pops a tent on the sidewalk, neighbors and local businesses call police immediately because encampments are not normalized here, and the tent is thrown in the trash. Worst outcome is someone pops the tent on private property and they are verbally/physically threatened before their tent is thrown away.

You can empathize with the homeless and gladly pay taxes to support people. You don't have to allow encampments to spring up in public places. You let that fester long enough under good intentions and you turn into [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON]. Look up the [ORGANIZATION] long skirmishes between police and activists over clearing encampments in FAC0 in [PERSON].

"DATE0 has almost 0 relevance to this conversation; cost of living is astronomically higher, while real wages have been stagnant for most of DATE1 DATE2. The housing crisis is an *affordability* crisis, and increasing supply across the board is a strategy to solve it.

I'd also push back on the idea there was no housing crisis in [LOCATION], since urban renewal efforts targeting ""overcrowded"" black neighborhoods began soon after WWII, as black renters were not allowed in many ""higher end"" (white) neighborhoods.

The rhetorical questions reinforce their point and highlight a societal expectation or critique regarding property ownership and responsibility. There is an implicit ""not in my backyard"" sentiment, as the comment defends property owners' rights and questions the fairness of blaming them. No racial bias is present."

They claim that no such institution exists locally and suggest a solution (an institution that accepts both). The mention of community help also implies a solution/intervention. The societal critique is implicit in the suggestion that current systems do not accommodate such needs. The deserving/undeserving perception is present in the empathy shown toward both the person and the dog, suggesting both deserve to stay together. No racial bias is present."

They critique the difficulty of building new housing (government critique, societal critique) and propose making the process easier (solution/intervention). The language suggests a ""not in my backyard"" attitude and a harmful generalization about PEH, but there is no racial bias present."

Reasoning: The commenter describes their repeated personal encounters with a specific individual, offering observations about his appearance, behavior, and reputation. They make claims about his housing and mental health status. The description of his behavior toward women and the advice on how to respond reflects both personal opinion and references to others' opinions (his ""reputation for being creepy"").

Reasoning: The commenter claims the country ""decided to encourage illegal immigration"" and links this to homelessness and low wages, expressing their opinion and making a claim.

The implication that ""illegal immigration"" is to blame for homelessness contains implicit racial bias, as it targets a group often racialized in public discourse."

Reasoning: The comment provides factual information about programs to fly homeless people back to the mainland and observations about the situation in the islands, including multigenerational homeless families with jobs and children in school. It expresses the opinion that sending homeless people to a place already struggling with homelessness is problematic and references residents' negative reactions. The mention of families who ""simply can’t afford a [STREET] to live"" highlights societal issues around affordability and challenges the stereotype that all homeless people are unemployed or undeserving.

They describe personal interactions (offering food, not being cussed out), and imply that PEH must ""want"" help, which reflects a deserving/undeserving judgment. The mention of ""bad attitude"" and refusal of food is a harmful generalization. There is a mild societal critique in the implication that resources exist but are not accessed.
