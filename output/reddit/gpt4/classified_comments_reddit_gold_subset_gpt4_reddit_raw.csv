"I know the corner of  [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] is one of the corners this guy apparently has people 'working.' The corner is always covered and it seems to rotate through a few of the same individuals, almost as if the are on shifts. I haven't heard much more than that, but I have heard the same thing from various people who work with homeless and/or addicts. I don't personally provide direct services or work with clients anymore so I haven't heard it myself but I trust those I have heard it from.

They mention personal experience (no longer working directly with clients) and relay secondhand information. No racial bias is present."
"Not a big surprise?

There is not a lack of low paying jobs here. The top needs of the panhandlers is usually mental care, which we as a society really suck at providing.

Perception Type: [deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The comment opens with a rhetorical question (""Not a big surprise?"") and then provides claims about the availability of low-paying jobs and the primary needs of panhandlers (mental care). The speaker expresses their opinion that society is failing to provide adequate mental health care and critiques the effectiveness of certain interventions. The mention of ""the top needs of the panhandlers"" and the ineffectiveness of giving ""a trashbag and $10 an hour"" implies a judgment about what kinds of help are appropriate or effective, touching on deservingness. There is no racial bias present."
"Good call [ORGANIZATION]. Many, not all, of the panhandlers don't want a job. A great deal of them are former residents of FAC0 in town. They are usually out there begging for money to pay for their addiction and put money in their dealers hand.

I believe a better option is to take any money that could have gone to this and continue to provide low cost housing for the truly homeless.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion about panhandlers and claims many are addicted and uninterested in jobs, which is a harmful generalization and makes judgments about who is ""truly homeless"" (deserving/undeserving). They critique how money is allocated (preferring housing and mental health over job programs), which falls under money aid allocation and societal critique. They also propose a solution (low-cost housing and mental health facilities). No racial bias is present."

There is no critique of government, money, or society.

"I experience the same comments with non-benders in my car. It's tough because we want [ORGANIZATION] to be better, and there's been large improvements. But there is still a [ORGANIZATION] of work to be done. At this point, I feel as if the homeless issue is starting to hold back development and other progress in the city, mainly downtown. I can't stress enough how delicate and sensitive of an issue this is for [ORGANIZATION]. Agree or not, we are a liberal city, with quite a few Democrats in charge. The bread of butter of Democrats is poor relief. Is the current situation a result of the current (local) administration/leaders? I mean, this doesn't happen overnight and is really a product of issues that effect the entire [PERSON] (is [ORGANIZATION] the only or select few with this problem? No). But here we are, with this issue in our laps. It doesn't matter so much as to how they got here. The real focus needs to be how to get them back onto their feet and self sufficient. There has been proven success with the housing first model. We don't have the capital to overnight the project and get results right away, so we are left in a holding pattern waiting for the first units to come online and gather data on how that works for us. 

I think this issue could actually be a fantastic opportunity for [ORGANIZATION] to step in. They have some of the brightest individuals there, that could use their resesrch expertise, and other knowledge to come with up with a collaborative approach with the City of [ORGANIZATION] to help tackle this problem the right [STREET]. I've always thought [ORGANIZATION] should be a little more involved with [ORGANIZATION], and I don't see why this issue would be any different. ORG2 benefits from a better [ORGANIZATION].

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion about the ""bum"" issue and claims that the problem is due to services offered to the homeless. The use of ""bums"" is a harmful generalization about people experiencing homelessness. There is societal critique implied in blaming services for the presence of homeless individuals. No explicit or implicit racial bias is present."

Reasoning: The commenter is expressing their opinion about the original poster's behavior and making a claim that the news story does not support the inflammatory statement. The critique is of how information is presented and sensationalized, which is a societal issue. The reference to a news story and its mismatch with the claim points to media portrayal.

It’s either build the center and have all of the people you’re so worried about in one [STREET] or have them out on the streets not getting the mental help they need.

Reasoning: The commenter claims that building the center is preferable to leaving people on the streets without help (fact/claim, opinion). They critique the societal attitude of opposing the center and highlight the hypocrisy of those who complain about visible homelessness (societal critique). They reference the intervention of building a center (solutions/interventions). The comment addresses NIMBY attitudes and challenges the notion of who ""deserves"" help by humanizing the homeless (""someone’s daughter/son/mother/father""). No racial bias is present."
"There are several reasons that someone couldn't stay at center for the homeless but could be at [ORGANIZATION].
Some are innocuous, such for example, [ORGANIZATION] doesn't allow pets, but [ORGANIZATION] does. [ORGANIZATION] is sex segregated so couples can't stay there together, but they can at [ORGANIZATION]. 

But the other big distinction is that [ORGANIZATION] isn't a low barrier shelter, so they have a strick drugs and alcohol policy, which [ORGANIZATION] does not.

"I just wanted to chime in that I think your question is so so so valid and I am glad you asked it. When you haven’t been around people experiencing active homelessness and potentially untreated mental health issues it can be scary at first bc let’s be real… all the unknown things and situations in our lives are scary for the most part- positive or negative. I am relieved to see all the posts on here educating and in support of giving humans a meal, electricity, and even a space to feel safe when they barely feel safe with their own thoughts. The library is doing a beautiful thing and if it truly bothers you that much that you refuse to go to the downtown location I think you really should just be grateful you have the option and resources to [STREET] 5 miles to the next library. And, I mean that genuinely.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their own opinion about the validity of the question and the importance of supporting people experiencing homelessness. They reference others' supportive posts and describe their husband's personal experience with someone suffering from mental health issues, which influenced his behavior. There is a subtle societal critique regarding people's discomfort and avoidance behaviors. The mention of being ""grateful"" for having options implies a deserving/undeserving perception, contrasting those with resources and those without. No racial bias is present."

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion and makes an observation about the location of homeless services, suggesting it should be in the center of the community for better access and support. This critiques societal decisions about where to place such facilities and implies a solution/intervention (better placement). The mention of ""most of the supporters"" and questioning why it's placed far away reflects a ""not in my backyard"" dynamic, though in a somewhat inverted way (suggesting it should be closer to the center, not pushed out).

"Yeah, anywhere a new [INSTITUTION] is built within the city it’s going to be near some residences and businesses, and until someone is willing to take a risk to change the situation by at least letting a new shelter try within walking distance of them nothing will improve.

They also express others’ opinions by stating that many would rather see homeless people in prison or dead than near their neighborhood, which critiques societal attitudes (societal critique). The mention of “letting a new shelter try” references a solution/intervention.

"Hey neighbor, I live over here as well! 

I share a lot of your concerns, but we have to remember that this needs to go *somewhere*. Its probably going to have a negative impact wherever it goes, it just happens we drew the short straw this time. I already sent an email to [ORGANIZATION] (and I should probably send one to [PERSON] as well) requesting some more specifics on what the plan is to maintain the neighborhood. Id suggest you do the same. The more pressure, the better. When this happens, because it certainly sounds like its going to, we are going to have to try to make the most of it. We will have a vested interest in making sure the residents there succeed and receive the resources they are promised. We will also need to make sure we hold the city's feet to the fire to make sure they fulfill their promises to us and maintain our neighborhood. 

Thankfully this is a little different than a soup kitchen or shelter. Its actual housing, its designed for people who are maybe one step up from living on the streets, but still one step down from being on their feet enough to live in someplace like FAC0.

"There have been polls taken from people living under the viaduct, around downtown, etc. in [ORGANIZATION] showing that they won’t accept city help, either because they prefer living homeless or don’t trust the government, or both.

Mayor [PERSON] would even go to the homeless encampments In Person and talk to those living there - even with personal persuasion, he couldn’t get people to not want to live under that viaduct.

"The meeting was a great showing of varying community opinion. Went from [TIME].

\- PERSON0 got truly irate

\- PERSON1 (mayors office) got called out for unintentionally lying and providing partial information [ORGANIZATION] night to council. [TIME] before the meeting too.

\- The main guy from [ORGANIZATION] said FAC0 started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after [TIME] when there is no presence on site. Some lady from [ORGANIZATION] who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to [LOCATION] and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- [ORGANIZATION] got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until [TIME]) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- [ORGANIZATION] and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- PERSON2 of [ORGANIZATION] berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from ORG2 essentially said the same thing. [ORGANIZATION] also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes [TIME] the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which [ORGANIZATION] said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with [ORGANIZATION] apologized because they were voting against.

\- PERSON4 also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly [ORGANIZATION] employees, and people like PERSON4 who only took up [TIME] total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give [TIME] to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition [TIME]?

\- [ORGANIZATION] had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the [ORGANIZATION] project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the [STREET]. [ORGANIZATION] kept repeating they asked their consultant (DATE2) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as [ORGANIZATION] while giving numerous sites labels of [LOCATION]. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- PERSON6 tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter ([ORGANIZATION]) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""[INSTITUTION]"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. [ORGANIZATION] said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 [PERSON] meetings, 1 of which is attended. The [PERSON] barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in [ORGANIZATION] without a site in mind so then it became urgent in [LOCATION] to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around DATE4. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side?

The mention of ""deserving/undeserving"" comes from the discussion about who should benefit from the housing and the opposition's arguments about resource allocation.

"Thanks for your thoughtful response. 

I'm curious how large complexes are more harmful? And I also thought [ORGANIZATION] doesn't allow visitors or drugs. Maybe a safe injection site is also needed so people aren't shooting up in people's yards. I think it was a little misguided that the director of [ORGANIZATION] said homelessness was done for with [ORGANIZATION] running. 

To the point of something outside the city, good luck getting the county to agree to that. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] hate homeless people to the point of calling them garbage. The county commissioners don't want to fund anything that isn't already a running program or a giant corporation trying to move in. [ORGANIZATION] didn't even pay attention to the meeting, just got the [INSTITUTION] to shut things down(there were clearly too many people, but that was an observation I had). Honestly if [ORGANIZATION] stops getting funded by the county I'm all down for camping in [ORGANIZATION]'s [ORGANIZATION] till he changes his mind.",southbend,"Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions]

"I like some of his ideas but I have a better chance being a pro basketball player than [ORGANIZATION] does consolidating departments or initiatives with [PERSON]. Him thinking that's possible makes me question if he's just saying that to get away with the ""how will you pay for this"" question than it either shows willful misleading or not understanding the dynamic between the two cities.

He seems to be trying to be the best of both worlds and say ""hey if you like [ORGANIZATION] and where the city is going I'm your guy but also hey [ORGANIZATION] is overrated and the city needs a lot of work"" it's an interesting strategy. I think he actually has a more critical view of [ORGANIZATION] and the city government than he let's on (which there is nothing wrong with) that I wish he would just come out in the open and say so the debate could be better.

Edit - For example it's easy to say the city is ""screwing around"" with the homeless situation, but to not give what you would actually so different. The city had a decent homeless initiative that was stopped by residents in unison saying you're not putting transition centers in ""my neighborhood"". So how do you get past that?

"So, I've changed a lot on this one over time. I spent [ORGANIZATION] as an advocate working against chronic homelessness, have participated on some of the city's [LOCATION] on homelessness, etc, but I don't think the city, nor this take are being entirely generous.

1 - yes, housing first is scientifically the most effective model for caring for the homeless. It's math, not feelings. It [LOCATION] - but... housing first doesn't give free license to do housing first poorly. there are ways to do zero barrier in ways that are more harmful and less harmful.3 - less harmful = scattered site. less harmful = day shelter programming and a more controlled check in/check out process. more harmful = large complexes. more harmful (to the community) = no day programming, free roaming, full freedom, full visitation (allows for drug dealers)4 - Motels4Now has been good for the homeless, but harmful for many near it. It just has. Businesses have closed, people feel less safe, and it decreases the dignity and pride of the people near it (who - as those on the [ORGANIZATION] side - have already dealt with a lot of disinvestment). I'm not sure it's fair to help some people by harming some others, especially when it's just due to not being willing to produce the funding to do it in a [STREET] that is even more helpful and less harmful.I think at this point my preference would be something outside of city limits, on the edge of town where there's still zero restrictions on sobriety, but still a more programmatic or controlled environment. And let's pay for a shuttle that can connect people to the bus line. Surely a small shuttle bus and a full-time driver is within financial reason, given the total project will cost millions anyway.

I'm not saying my idea is the best one. But we at least have to have some compassion for the real expressed needs of neighbors and business owners without painting them out to be petty or greedy.

"Pretty strong rhetoric here. [ORGANIZATION] administers both homeless prevention assistance and housing assistance for thousands of people [ORGANIZATION]. And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. [ORGANIZATION] literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at [TIME] to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG2 does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

I'm very sorry to hear that you're having a hard time keeping up with building codes. I hope that you can make the adjustments required for you to continue helping people in a [STREET] that's safe, and I hope that you're able to continue to increase what you do for the community.

"Her live video [TIME] does some more name dropping, [ORGANIZATION] and the mayor were at the event she went to.

"A lot of people commenting are assuming the people she's helping have a phone and can call for help themselves. Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss [PERSON]'s bc they know she has [LOCATION] and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break. 

I am not saying that there is or isn't a reason to be concerned, I don't know either [STREET], but some of the comments are petty [ORGANIZATION]. She's asking for immediate donations of food, shows the lack of food and the line of people and when the food is delivered they see the hungry people. She goes live all the time and shows the volunteers, donations and those she's helping. I think she is helping them and that those complaining or questioning haven't proven otherwise.

Please excuse my sarcasm and my bad dry jokes my humor I love to go sense of humor and a bad bad joke set [ORGANIZATION] but I am indeed just trying to keep this light because I really don't know what the problem is I have lived in [ORGANIZATION] for [DATE] and I just recently heard about Miss [PERSON]'s and maybe [ORGANIZATION] and I haven't heard anything but very good things about the establishment and her in general but again I mentioned personal experiencing I don't have to go into detail cuz it doesn't really matter but I I was helped greatly by Miss [PERSON] and never having met her in my entire life nor had she met me and I know that putting this down here but I bet you're wrong and I'm pretty transparent if anybody wants to know they can ask very easy to send somebody in private message but you know I'm not going to throw it out there it doesn't matter if I'm just going to say it's not I'm guessing it's probably not what you think unless you somehow or never mind whoever you I'm speaking of generally like whoever it is that has these issues and problems against Miss [PERSON] personally or Miss [PERSON]'s and in general I'm just curious I'd like to know why you taking such an interest in doing this and I wonder if it was you that had something to do with shut getting there needle exchange and shut down or any of the other things that help people that aren't perfect or that do things that you don't like I don't know I think that what my problem is more than anything else doesn't matter who it is or where it is or who these people are who you are who any thing related to whatever it is take what is is it your job to do this I just am wondering like again I'm going to say I'm just so curious as to what made you dislike the [STREET] so much that you're going to sit there and you're going to as far as I know slender I don't know that any of this is true I'd like to see your proof but I guess again I don't know anything about this and I'm just my anger is in the fact of that it's things like this that have the world set to where it is right now thank God you can't quit feeling things for [PERSON]'s sake hey come leave people alone is what I mean keep feeling it's the one [STREET] or another about things you don't like maybe your life would be a little bit happier but definitely like my mom would say leave people the f alone right I say quit feeling others just say let you I also noticed that you put down all of those things that must have took some time to get all that information and everything I sure hope that you're right about all of them and I'll end right now because I'm getting so irritated and going on and thinking about this but I noticed there wasn't anything I put out as far as how many meals have been served how many homeless people have been housed how many people have gotten to go to rehabilitation services that otherwise wouldn't have . How many rides have been given how many people have closed that didn't have clothes hygiene supplies that didn't have supplies if this [STREET] gets shut down are you going to help the people or you know complain more that there's people on the corners asking for money while you're complaining to get the places to help them shut down.

Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [personal interaction, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter repeatedly expresses their own opinion and observations, referencing both their personal experience with homelessness services and the opinions/actions of others. They ask several genuine questions about the motives behind criticism of organizations helping PEH (people experiencing homelessness). There is societal critique, particularly about attitudes toward helping ""imperfect"" people (e.g., drug addicts), and frustration with those who oppose such help. The commenter references their own positive personal interaction with a service provider. They also discuss the impact of interventions (meals served, people housed, rehabilitation), fitting the solutions/interventions category. There is some implication of deserving/undeserving (defending the worthiness of drug addicts and homeless people for help). No racial bias is present."
"I will try to save everyone [TIME] of their life by summarizing the Live video.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed a few complaints on her fb page.  First, she addressed the gal who expressed frustration of clothes, personal care bags, food, razors, feminine products being dumped around her home.  The woman asked miss [ORGANIZATION] volunteers to come pick it up since it’s a regular problem.  [ORGANIZATION] addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets [ORGANIZATION] while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.  That doesn’t happen anymore,  but instead it became the neighbors problem.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at [ORGANIZATION]’s a few times and was angry at how she wasn’t helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed it saying it’s because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers aren’t sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her [STREET] is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is [ORGANIZATION] register [ORGANIZATION] may turn out to be a blessing for her, per [ORGANIZATION] (not in those words).  She can’t comment on the article per the board, but so many people have offered support since the article so these things may get addressed by volunteers in the community.  I feel so bad for these businesses being sucked into this when the economy hasn’t been the best for all lines of business.  Do they know she raised $400k for a $175k building?  I also felt bad for the Mexican restaurant donating so many meals DATE2.  I hope the food goes to those that need it, but cash flow at restaurants has been tough since [PERSON] and inflation.  But, I suppose they consider it advertisement.",rockford,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions]

There is critique of how money is managed and spent, and some societal critique regarding volunteer sobriety and community burden. Solutions/interventions are discussed (e.g., more trash cans, volunteers picking up trash, volunteering as addiction recovery). The deserving/undeserving perception appears in the discussion of who receives help and the implication that some may not be as deserving. No racial bias is present."

Well she has a script for when she sends another soul into the cold with a couple of sleeping bags to sleep his drunk off.  And is she doing any intake to get people into the homeless single point of entry system like she is required  to do per the [ORGANIZATION]?,rockford,"Comment Type: [provide an observation, ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim, express their opinion]  
Critique Category: [societal critique]

racist: [No]  
Reasoning: The commenter observes and critiques the actions of a person (likely a service provider), questions whether proper procedures are being followed, and implies judgment about the adequacy of the help provided (e.g., just giving sleeping bags to someone drunk). This reflects skepticism about the effectiveness or appropriateness of the intervention, and questions whether the person is fulfilling their responsibilities. There is no racial bias present."
"1) Its close to [ORGANIZATION]. I love that its really quick to jump on the highway and be there in [TIME] or so. housing is less expensive

2) I hate the crime and gang violence that spills out of the west side of [PERSON]. it also acts like a catch all for the riff raff coming out of [ORGANIZATION]. the homeless is a growing issue too. 

The roads are crap because you get the worst of [ORGANIZATION] being down well below 0 for [LOCATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] are well above the 90s for [LOCATION]. the springs and falls are nice but its [ORGANIZATION] of each. 

[PERSON] is also a highly industrial area, except that was [PERSON]. alot of empty rusted dilapidated buildings that hipsters start a business in for [PERSON] then go under.

this area is extremely blue collar, the only thing that they like to do is go to bars. Not really a music or art culture here. just bars. 

people here cant [STREET] worth a shit. guys in [ORGANIZATION] are still wearing skater shoes with chain wallets. Moms smoke in their cars with their babies listening to papa roach. 

since they passed a gambling law, there are slots on every corner and in every [STREET] imaginable. They also passed another granting [PERSON] to build a casino [PERSON] or DATE8. So the people that live paycheck to paycheck that already have problems can go to surrender what they have left. But the city gets a bit of the profit, which you'll never see get implemented to benifit you in any [STREET]

3) I wish [PERSON] had one [STREET] that wasnt constantly covered in trash.

4) I would vist the surrounding towns in [PERSON], or even GPE2. but each town will have its own challenges. like when a chemical tool plants explodes and burns for [ORGANIZATION]#x200B;

Final thoughts: You might need to reconsider what youre willing to sacrifice for what you hope to gain. The [ORGANIZATION] is just one big cornfield of poverty. Im personally biased in that I hope a nuclear bomb goes off in this city. I would say that maybe just rent for [LOCATION]0 to experience the seasons and they [STREET] people act like here. Sure we dont have [ORGANIZATION] like you do in [LOCATION], but we have plenty of suicidal alcoholic domestic abusers that fly their freak flag here. So its a trade off. If you do decide to move here, make sure you lock your doors at [TIME] and chain down what you dont want stolen.

No explicit or implicit racial bias is present."
"Even if there is homeless people coming to [ORGANIZATION], so what? Theyre people, they need shelter too.

"The city has been practicing the [ORGANIZATION] program for [ORGANIZATION].  What housing first does is provide shelter first, and then addresses the person's other issues.  The city also put a lot of people up in rooms during [PERSON] because they got funding for it.  It makes no sense that [ORGANIZATION] would pay for people's rent. The city has been so successful with [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] is a model for other cities.  The city also collaborates with other agencies to reduce overlap and gaps.  However, the city employees can't post on social media about what they do.  [ORGANIZATION] rarely speaks of the work and programs of the city and other agencies.  

It isn't compassionate to supply people to live rough indefinitely, and put a strain on community spaces when bedding, tents, clothing, and food waste are dumped and abandoned buildings go up in flames.  It is reckless to give people hope that they can live sustainably with a cup of ramen, a few blankets and a tent in [LOCATION].  That is why no other agency in town provided materials to live outdoors, they provide shelter first.  However, the city can't force anyone to accept help, so there will always be un-sheltered people.

Here are some links on the work the city does.

Reasoning: The commenter provides factual claims and observations about the city's ""housing first"" approach and its effectiveness, as well as opinions on what is and isn't compassionate or effective. There is critique of societal approaches to homelessness (e.g., supplying materials for rough sleeping vs. providing shelter) and discussion of resource allocation (funding, program overlap).

"Is the increase in referrals due to people being homeless?  How long are people waiting for treatment after the referral?

"Most of those funds go to programs for housing and homeless prevention.They, for a while, also could go towards temporarily sheltering people. So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for [ORGANIZATION], or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for [LOCATION].  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in [STREET], and certain things that these funds simply can't help with. 

Then there's a couple programs that help people pay utility bills, but those are usually paid for with funds that are separate from what I was talking about before.",rockford,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation]

Wealth is not directly correlated with expendable time. The wealthiest people I’ve met and know are some of the busiest people I’ve ever met. They’re always on call and always working.

There are developers that are building apartments for low income but it’s not at a pace that can keep up with the issue. The creamery and the development on FAC0 for example.

By the [STREET], most folks who are unhoused are not actually living on the streets or other public places.  Most are doubled-up with friends or family members, or living in motels/hotels.

* When people don't have housing, it's much harder for them to actually spend time finding a steady job or other source of income

"Yeah, but specifically how? 

Tax rates for the wealthy are going down, not up. As you've seen in [ORGANIZATION] now, passing anything, even with democrats in power, is nearly impossible. Including tax hikes (fun fact: the bill being debated right now - is more than 25% tax cuts. As in the infrastructure bill is more than 25% tax cuts. And the Democrats are...in power, not the Republicans).

People always have simple answers to big problems, and these simple answers solve none of the problems. It is actually.... probably the saddest thing I've witnessed, in general over my life. 

We've said we would solve so much. Climate change, gun violence, equality, social mobility - and we've made zero progress on any of these. We've made negative progress, even. We can't even legalize marijuana at the federal level. 

Here's a simple solution to solving climate change; just do it. Just do it. Easy, right?

People on this subreddit keep asking the same questions, and providing the same simple answers. And yet they are amazed that they are unsatisfied with the results. Here's what the people asking these questions don't want to hear; invite the homeless in to your house. Or take your paycheck, and buy a house for the homeless person, or buy the homeless person a [ORGANIZATION] at a hotel. These are actual solutions that any of us can do. It just takes sacrifice from us. How many of us do you see making these sacrifices? None.

"I get what you’re saying, but free phones and phone service can be easy to obtain. The government cellphones don’t cost a thing. I see booths set up around my part of town (e. FAC0) that encourage people to come sign up for a free phone. 

And tbh the world of technology we live in now considers a cell phone to be a basic need, and rightfully so. There aren’t any more pay phones, or they are at least few and far between. Society is dependent on technology. Being homeless is hard enough. I despise that these asshats ruined the park for such a long time, but they are people. They are humans. They are important to someone, even if they aren’t even a blip on my radar, every person in that park has value and is special and important to someone. They deserve basic human kindness and it is society’s duty to care for and support each other. I am totally ok with my tax dollars being used to buy a phone and service for someone who can’t do it for themselves. Life is already hard enough. We can provide this support to have available basic human needs. 

I do get what you’re saying. I was jealous of the camp sites down there. They got better shit than I do. And I work my ass off to keep my head just above water. But it is a little bit on the ignorant side to just assume that a homeless person should not be entitled to basic needs. Or even something better. They have it rough enough, and maybe they don’t want to be pitied, maybe that’s condescending, but show some compassion. It goes a long [STREET]. :)

"The difficulty with issues like homelessness is that much money has gone into addressing it without success. Just housing everyone who is homeless doesnt work. American society in general provides ample opportunity despite what some may tell you to provide for yourself.

A surprisingly large percentage of the population has an iq too low even for the military. Here is an area of research where in which you could come up with a revolutionary solution!) If this were not the case immigrants would not risk their lives to come here and find success. This is still the land of opportunity.

“The law, in its majestic equality, forbids both rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges”

The sex offender problem is sort of tied up in the rest of this. We (rightly) do not want people who prey on children living close to where children congregate- but then we don’t have anywhere else for those people to go. They wind up homeless, no fixed address, and then if they do reoffend it’s harder to find them.

There should be a monitored halfway house for those kinds of offenders- but that’s a small number of the total unhoused population.

[PERSON]'s thoughts on the people's resolution:

>“It resonated as a stand alone, attention seeking, self aggrandizement, document in my eyes, which actually ignored our current efforts, did not build upon or improve our existing efforts, was condescending toward staff’s actual hard work in this arena, and was disappointing…. an opportunity for a rather small group of individuals to sufficiently stack the deck to speak, with their preferred track force members in order to gain more influence than they currently possess.”

What I think was strange about [PERSON]'s version was that it over-emphasized the [ORGANIZATION]'s efforts on housing insecurity and homelessness. Those are important things that align with my personal values, but that's not what we're talking about. We need to increase housing supply and expedite its production so that people just have options of places to live. I believe we're making steady progress doing this like removing commercial parking requirements, creating pre-approved design plans for infill developments downtown, FAC0 improvement plan...but there are some critical approaches we have not addressed. They are local actions that impact housing supply and local prices:

* **Hire another planner or two** to work with landowners to rezone more properties to allow housing in more places (e.g. FAC0 improvement project that's underway or our [ORGANIZATION] in our [ORGANIZATION] Plan 2040 our city refuses to act on). 
* You know those brownstones in [ORGANIZATION]? Triple-deckers in [PERSON]? They are illegal to build in most of our city due to zoning. **Reform our development code.** I believe it's a problem that it's easier to build sprawling subdivisions, and harder to build compact and traditional living. We need to change the code from [ORGANIZATION] zoning to form-based zoning. [PERSON] and [PERSON] are addressing this with a world-renowned consultant right now. If [PERSON] chooses to fall behind those two cities in urban planning, it will be laughable. 
* **Reduce/reform parking minimums** for residential (maybe using overlay districts) and simultaneously invest in transit. [PERSON] is offering cities in [PERSON] a match for transit investment (design of bus stops) and the [ORGANIZATION] has not taken them up on it. 
* [ORGANIZATION] councilmembers: **Stop holding rezone requests hostage.** 

Personally, I'm mostly annoyed that it seems several councilmembers don't recognize that [PERSON] **has made great progress** ***and*** **can do more.** There IS work to be done ...do they see that? I'm concerned that they know, they just don't want it.

"Copying my comment from r/fayettevillear 

It has gotten out of hand. They are taking over walker park. I’ve seen many tents in the woods in the disk golf course. A little further south down the greenway, there are tons of tents in the woods and often times when riding my bike on the trails I would run into some pretty scary figures. I haven’t been back since I’ve been scared of being robbed of my bike..

Riding in [DATE] I probably saw at least 20 tents along the greenway in a 3 mile ride from FAC0 to FAC1. It was like they were everywhere.

Also a huge homeless encampment on the north side of the greenway here:

"I’m curious, what exactly did you do to help before? I ask because, as someone formerly homeless I literally had maybe a handful of people who actually offered any kind of material help and usually it really wasn’t much.

In fact, when I was denied [ORGANIZATION] benefits for the second time because I was foolish enough to mention during the phone interview, after all the paperwork I completed and having to wait [ORGANIZATION] for the opportunity to get  1 phone call I better not miss or have to start all over, that I mentioned I sometimes would prepare and have meals with my girlfriend. And I was denied because I refused to do as they ask and go to this woman, one of the few people who actually stood by me and saw me get out of that situation, my real guardian angel, that I felt it was inappropriate for me to then have to ask her for her [ORGANIZATION], every detail of her personal finances, ask for her college transcript, take all this very detailed personal information making her vulnerable to whoever had it and turn it over to the county and state just so I could get a couple hundred a month I could use and only use making sure I, at the very least, had food in my stomach.

When I was a homeless man, asking one of the very few programs that offer any kind of help or relief just for the help of food was denied that help. And to have that be the second time of paperwork and waiting and phone interviews and then waiting some more just to find out that our system denied a working homeless person who because of pride had put off even asking for help until I realized why not her help if it’s there. That’s when I realized it actually wasn’t there.

People talk a lot about “all the things the homeless get” and as you said yourself they’re “freeloaders” without realizing that in fact most get little to anything and the ones who do get something’s had to and have to continually fight and work to keep getting anything. All while living in a constant state of stress and trauma.

The fact is, and this is a fact you can look at the numbers yourself, we spend [STREET] more money on the bureaucracy we require to deny people help than we spend on the help that we go to great lengths to make it as difficult and shameful as we possibly can make it to get. 

That woman who had that [TIME] long phone interview with me, who I’m sure is a good and kind person trying to survive like the rest of us, that woman was getting payed. And as an employee of the city and county of [ORGANIZATION] was likely making near 6 figures if not in fact 6 figures. And we as a society payed her that sum on [LOCATION] to find a reason to deny a homeless person, sober, working and struggling, we denied a homeless person food.

So, when you say you used to do what you could to help people, besides the tax dollars that are spent “helping” in the [STREET] I described above, what exactly was that help? You’d occasionally give some coins to someone to leave you alone? You’d occasionally decide not to call the police on someone who other than being unsightly was causing no other real harm or disturbance.

Because call me crazy, but I’m maybe a little suspicious of the guy saying he’d happily look the other [STREET] if the city decided to “crack some heads”  that maybe just maybe you in fact have never really been much help to the people you’re here advocating state violence against so casually and brazenly.

Something tells me you likely would do more for a stray dog then to address in any helpful or constructive [STREET] the human misery we all have to see everyday and that pieces of shit who sound an awful lot like you do do everything in their power to undermine and put requirements on which end up increasing the costs to all of our tax dollars, not just you but all the people who actually give a damn about other human beings want actually spent on just helping people the fuck out when they’re in a tight spot.

Don’t bother with any of the usual “I’m glad to hear your doing better” or any of that crap because i already know what you think about me because of it and i guarantee you I know who you think is to blame for me being in that circumstance and I’m tired of hearing fake niceties by people who are so morally bankrupt that i already know that the time I took here to ask a basic fucking question and safeguard it from the usual bad faith horseshit that’s always employed to side step these things is almost for sure just a waste of my fucking time and effort because your not gonna hear a god damn word of what I have to say. Or you’ll call me a liar maybe or find some other bad faith misdirect or just simply resort to ad hominem or some other logical fallacy bullshit to muddy my points and force me to waste even more time debating someone who doesn’t actually have any intention of fixing anything or helping anyone and would rather see  “heads cracking”.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by contrasting living with a messy college roommate to living with a ""lice infested, [PERSON], and sometimes violently deranged homeless person,"" which also constitutes a harmful generalization about people experiencing homelessness (PEH).

Reasoning: The comment contains both rhetorical and genuine questions about enforcement and criminalization, provides claims about causes of homelessness and the effects of criminalization, and expresses opinions on preferred interventions.

"The taxes I pay could easily provide them and barely scratch the fiscal budget. But since they don't, I am also a serial $20 [PERSON]. That's what I would say had you not just used the most tired, unoriginal cop-out that people who want to shirk responsibility *love* to throw around. 

There's no two ways about it. These people are lacking resources, we have *plenty* of resources, but poor government planning, spending, and regulation, combined with people who don't see the homeless as humans and simply want to kick them out, are keeping the resouces out of their hands. 

You know how when you live in a society, it's everyone's responsibility to pay taxes so we can have roads and schools? Well, as society is made up of humans and humans can't really do much without each others' help, it's also your responsibility to take care of each other. Look at the homeless people in your neighborhood. They are your neighbors whether they sleep in a house or a tent. They are neglected and abused, and the problems that you face because of their existence ([ORGANIZATION] fires) could easily be solved if society just offered a *little* bit more support.",portland,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, express their opinion, provide an observation]

Reasoning: The commenter claims taxes could easily provide for homeless people and critiques government planning and societal attitudes, indicating both government and societal critique as well as money/resource allocation. They express their opinion about collective responsibility and observe that homeless people are neglected and abused. They suggest that more support would solve problems, which is a solution/intervention.

"[ORGANIZATION] has universal healthcare that includes substance abuse and mental heathcare. The [PERSON] does not. 

Housing first in the [PERSON] works great for someone that is down on their luck, someone living in their car or couch surfing for [ORGANIZATION]. It can get otherwise ok people back on their feet and back into a job. These are the invisible homeless that are not the problem we see on the streets. These are not the people that [ORGANIZATION] is picking up literal tons of garbage after, these are not the drug users leaving needles in children's playgrounds. 

Housing first will not work with the chronic homeless without massive investments in drug programs and mental healthcare. The only change would be instead of a tent bike chop shop and drug den, it will be a tax payer subsidized apartment based bike chop shop and drug den. 

The very people that are the problem we see on the streets are still going to be a problem, they will just be a problem that is also contributing to the housing shortage. The only solution are mental hospitals where these people can be forced to receive the care they need. And as they get better they can be given more freedom and perhaps even jobs at the hospital where they can learn the skills to enter the public again. 

Leaving them on the streets while whining about boulders under a bridge is not the solution. Anyone who thinks these people should be left on the streets is a terrible person.",portland,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion]

">""increased law enforcement"" implies people want more cops.

>Actual responses in the article suggest people want increased enforcement of laws.

How has this become the takeaway for people from this article? It's hardly the main point.

First of all, we need both - the cops we have need to do a better job of enforcing the laws, and we need more cops to cover more areas, more consistently, and to make sure there is sufficient availability for them to respond whenever a call for assistance comes in, even if it's not an immediate emergency. 

But the real issue here is something else entirely - that by a clear majority, people in this city are sick and tired of people simply being allowed to do whatever they want, wherever they want, without consequence. Not because they're not compassionate, not because they don't understand that many people who are homeless truly got there through no fault of their own or that most of us could relatively easily end up in the same situation, but because they realize that for those that struggle the most to make responsible choices, an overall approach that prioritizes permissiveness and enabling is the worst possible ""solution"" - for them and for the rest of us. 

Speaking from personal experience here - the last thing a person needs when they are finding it hard to make good choices is for someone to make it easier to make bad ones.",portland,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions, personal interaction]

Reasoning: The commenter provides claims about public opinion and law enforcement, observes the article's content, and expresses both their own and others' opinions (e.g., ""people in this city are sick and tired...""). They critique societal approaches to homelessness, particularly permissiveness and enabling. They discuss solutions/interventions (better law enforcement, more police, less permissiveness). The perception of ""deserving/undeserving"" is present in the distinction between those who ""struggle to make responsible choices"" and the implication that permissiveness is harmful. There is a brief mention of personal experience. No racial bias is present."

Reasoning: The comment begins with a genuine question about mental illness in homeless camps, then expresses the speaker's opinion about the causes of mental illness among homeless individuals, and provides a claim about the proportion of ""truly mentally ill"" versus ""crazy junkeys."" It critiques societal understanding of homelessness by distinguishing between those ""born with"" mental illness and those who ""chose"" drug use, which introduces harmful generalizations and judgments about who is deserving or undeserving of help.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by using the phrase ""Homeless Industrial Complex"" and implies criticism of harm reduction supplies, making a claim that ""dirty needles"" are being paid for with tax dollars.

The use of ""dirty needles"" generalizes harm reduction efforts negatively, which is a harmful generalization about services for PEH. There is no racial bias present."

> GPE1, [PERSON]. -- Like everyone in our city, state and across this nation, we mourned the senseless killing of [PERSON]. To now learn that family members staged this brutal killing is beyond belief and represents a double tragedy. They were responsible for taking [ORGANIZATION]'s life with unconscionable cruelty, and contrived to do so in our city under the guise of random violence, exploiting the legitimate fears of our residents. I commend our homicide detectives for their expert and tireless work in bringing those truly responsible to justice in this very troubling and sad case.

Reasoning: The comment presents factual claims and observations about a high-profile murder case that was initially blamed on a panhandler (implying a homeless person), but was later revealed to be staged by family members. The mayor's statement critiques the exploitation of public fears about random violence (often associated with homelessness), which is a societal issue.

A great analogy- Think about who buys new cars versus used cars. It's not all that different. Yet, as [ORGANIZATION] points out, ""There's no outcry about [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable car crisis""—because [ORGANIZATION] has plenty of affordable cars, just not affordable brand new cars.

"This is a good point. I'm not sure if you're using this as an argument that people WANT segregation, or if you're just pointing out something you've seen, but the idea of gentrification brings attention to how out-of-balance things are. 

Gentrification is fucking awesome to people who own property, right? Like - if I bought a home for $40k and suddenly that neighborhood became the [STREET] to be, I'd be pumped to earn over 1000% on my investment over [ORGANIZATION]. 

But let's face it: **Gentrification is happening in places where the people living there do NOT own property.** They're tenants renting someone else's property. The ""kind"" landlords will raise rent to merely catch up with tax assessments and basic inflation, the rest of them will go ""the market value has changed"" (I put ""kind"" in quotes because very, very, very few landlords are anything but exploitative). 

***

So when we look at answering questions about systemic racism and living/property costs and wealth, a few things come up:

- Generational wealth is a concept that has positively impacted whites at a higher rate than [ORGANIZATION]. Everything from slavery to [ORGANIZATION] to redlining so every other flavor of systemic racism, the privilege of building and passing on generational wealth isn't afforded to many [ORGANIZATION]. Escaping the poverty loop is hard enough - and when you don't have generational wealth to build/pass on, you're stuck renting and hoping you don't get gentrified out of your living situation.
 - With no generational wealth, you greatly reduce the likelihood that the affected person can purchase a home
 - YES - white people deal with this too, albeit on a less-proportional level, and without the many other roadblocks. It needs to be understood that certain measures that may benefit [ORGANIZATION] may benefit whites in this same position...
- Accessibility to homes for those who might actually be in a position to purchase is waning. If you're [ORGANIZATION] from the east side and you want to remain in the community you grew up in, you might be looking at the east side. You might find something that's within your price range. You might also learn that your home's value may not appreciate faster than the rate of inflation because of where you are.
 - ""Crime!"" some of the neolibs and conservatives will cry. ""It's that [STREET] because of crime! Fix the crime and values will go up!"" Perhaps - but tell me how much that value actually goes up when the sounds of the 33 drown out your backyard [ORGANIZATION].
 - Hidden barriers. Aside from the pseudo-redlining that still happens among [ORGANIZATION], those $40,000 homes on the east side often require additional money to make them comfortably habitable. 
- NIMBY will always be a huge roadblock. Every time anyone ever mentions ""affordable housing"" - whether it's an income-based apartment complex or some allocation for some affordable path to home ownership, people make a stink. They will fight for ""those people"" to go back to to the [STREET] they belong and then use every dog whistle, holier-than-thou argument, and sob story about how the safety of their neighborhood is at risk.",buffalo,"Comment Type: [express their opinion, provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express others opinions]

There is a huge income disparity in ORGANIZATION.
I have found myself homeless here twice in [ORGANIZATION]. 

Once because of a job that closed (FAC1). Another time because I rented one of those *reasonably* priced apartments and dealt with a crazy landlord who would often come into my apartment. Sometimes when I was home, others when I was not home. That's just the start of it.

(Disclaimer: Being white and educated doesn't mean you aren't poor, a lot of people are educated here and job competition is vicious.)
I am white.
I have a DATE1 degree.
I do smoke pot, so that has definitely been a huge obstacle for me to overcome in regards to professional jobs.
But other than that I do not drink, take pills or other drugs.

So other than that, [ORGANIZATION] can be a great city to live in.
But the downsides are the nepotism, cold, income disparity, high rental prices, lack of reasonable bus system(that arrives on time or to the suburbs), [ORGANIZATION] collar/non-union).

"The issue isn’t that the use of demolition: it was the indiscriminate use of demolition without consideration or alternative or long term plan, and worse, that it continued even as [ORGANIZATION] began its “renaissance” and through to [ORGANIZATION].

Again, do I blame them for using sound public policy for DATE5 city planning? No, but the lack of follow up and no transition to an alternative policy as [ORGANIZATION] (in particular it’s real estate market) improve is just so frustrating. The result has been hyper increases in valuation and gentrification in some neighborhoods and intensifying concentration of poverty in others, and allowing developers to tear down huge swaths of [ORGANIZATION] (as some folks above seem to be salivating for) won’t change that: leadership and effective public policy will.",buffalo,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, express their opinion, provide an observation]

"And they're asking people to donate food, clothing, and baby supplies -- not tents. As a lifelong democrat, no I am not universally opposed to social programs.

The reality is that the [ORGANIZATION] could donate the tent and camping supplies to a local nonprofit that could make good use of it. This is not as flashy or righteous as giving it to LGBTQ homeless people. The best outcome is someone pops a tent on the sidewalk, neighbors and local businesses call police immediately because encampments are not normalized here, and the tent is thrown in the trash. Worst outcome is someone pops the tent on private property and they are verbally/physically threatened before their tent is thrown away.

You can empathize with the homeless and gladly pay taxes to support people. You don't have to allow encampments to spring up in public places. You let that fester long enough under good intentions and you turn into [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON]. Look up the [ORGANIZATION] long skirmishes between police and activists over clearing encampments in FAC0 in [PERSON].

[ORGANIZATION] isn't a wealthy or glamorous city, but people value nice, safe public spaces.

"DATE0 has almost 0 relevance to this conversation; cost of living is astronomically higher, while real wages have been stagnant for most of DATE1 DATE2. The housing crisis is an *affordability* crisis, and increasing supply across the board is a strategy to solve it.

Not everywhere needs to have middle density housing options, but you also don't want to completely suburbanize parts of [ORGANIZATION] with single-family homes, especially when it means higher utility costs and greenhouse gas emissions per capita. 

I'd also push back on the idea there was no housing crisis in [LOCATION], since urban renewal efforts targeting ""overcrowded"" black neighborhoods began soon after WWII, as black renters were not allowed in many ""higher end"" (white) neighborhoods.

Reasoning: The commenter claims that the ""urine smell"" decreases after homeless people are bussed out, which is both an observation and a claim.

"[PERSON]. You don’t have to. But, spoiler: [ORGANIZATION] also has the same program to fly homeless people back to the mainland. The [ORGANIZATION] program though is about reuniting people with family who may be able to help them as well as the state providing some support once they arrive. Neither the [ORGANIZATION] nor [PERSON] program are about simply dumping people but, the idea of sending homeless people to [ORGANIZATION] which has a very serious homeless problem to begin with did not sit well with residents.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their own opinion and references others' opinions (e.g., ""your wonderful governor""), uses rhetorical questions to make a point about perceived hypocrisy, and critiques both government (governor, sanctuary state policies) and societal attitudes (expecting people to welcome homeless individuals). The ""not in my backyard"" perception is present in the suggestion that people should welcome homeless individuals to their neighborhoods, implying resistance.

"Someone mentioned gas stations, and I second that advice.

I have several friends whi are mangers at different [ORGANIZATION] gas stations and give homeless regulars  a ""job"" which is really just taking out the garbage and keeping the outside of the store clean in exchange for hot food that they are going to toss anyway, and even water and coffee. As long as they don't scare the customers away by hanging out/sleeping/begging on the premises, it works out well.

One of them had a woman who was outside of his store for [ORGANIZATION], rain or shine, in heat or cold. Her son was in prison, and she was trying to raise money to get an apartment for herself and him so that he would have a [STREET] to go when he got out. She was very friendly and never asked anyone for money outright - just would give a friendly ""hi"" and have [DATE].And if people gave her money, she would thank them, and she saved every penny - never used any on herelf so my friend let her get water/food from inside. I would stop and chat with her sometimes, that's how I know why she was out there. My friend let her stay out there all the [STREET] until she had the money to get her own [STREET]. I remember the last time I saw her, she updated me and told me she had got a [STREET] and was now trying to find some cheap furniture. I haven't seen her out there since, so  I'm glad that she made it.

My other friend who manages another [ORGANIZATION], had a guy there who he exchanged food and drinks for cleaning up the outside of the property and emptying the trash.  That worked out well for [LOCATION]. I would see this guy there all the time and it worked out well for both of them until recently -  he had to finally kick the guy out because he started bringing his friends who were  addicts and they started building a makeshift house on the side of the building and were kind of creeping the customers out.

They provide factual claims about these arrangements and express their opinion that this system ""works out well.""

"DATE0 I volunteered at a [INSTITUTION] called [ORGANIZATION], they have an immediate outreach center where you can get a shower and do your laundry along with a meal all free of charge, they’re located a bit east of downtown on 130 N cotton st, would highly recommend giving them a visit",elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion]

"It's a pretty well known fact that most homeless people will try to migrate to an area that is more open/accommodating to homelessness AND that their destination has good to great weather [ORGANIZATION] round. Why would homeless people stay in [ORGANIZATION], much less [PERSON] with our climate? Not surprised in the least about what this map shows.",elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization]

"I've been living in [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] and although the homeless population isn't nearly as bad as other major cities, I have noticed an increase since the pandemic. Not sure what the root cause is either. 

I speculate that a lot of homeless come from out of town and end up staying here because they noticed is so quiet and peaceful compared to say [PERSON] or GPE2.",elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide an observation, express their opinion]
Critique Category: []
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [personal interaction, harmful generalization]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter shares their personal observation about an increase in homelessness since the pandemic and speculates about the reasons, including that homeless people come from out of town for a quieter environment.

There is no critique, solution, or racial bias present."
"The issue is infrastructure and transportation. The whole point is to be able to have affordable housing with nearby public transportation. If you're in affordable housing, you most likely don't have a vehicle, so public transportation is going to be your main source of movement. Sadly [ORGANIZATION] is shitty when it comes to accessibility without a personal vehicle. We really are spread thin without much density.",elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, express their opinion]

Many many cities realized the cheapest solution to the unhoused in their city is a bus ticket and bribe. Send them to be someone else's problem.,elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, express their opinion]  
Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique, money aid allocation]  
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]  
Perception Type: [deserving/undeserving]  
racist: [No]  
Reasoning: The commenter claims that cities use bus tickets and bribes to move unhoused people elsewhere, which is both a factual claim (about city actions) and an opinion (implied criticism). This critiques government and societal approaches, as well as resource allocation (choosing a cheap ""solution"" over substantive help). The mention of ""send them to be someone else's problem"" implies a judgment about who deserves help and reflects a societal attitude toward homelessness. No racial bias is present."
"I have not experienced 'aggression', though I do see homeless people. They often come to check out my apartment complex's dumpster in the evening, which I know because I can see from my window, and I see homeless people resting or signs of habitation underneath the bridges over train tracks and interstates and places like that.

All I can say is that you would probably be 'rude' if you were homeless too - constantly watching your back, not knowing when you'll get your next meal, having no reliable [STREET] of comfort and refuge. 

[ORGANIZATION] is pretty bad for homeless too - it can be hard to even find a bathroom as someone with no car. I've been told to walk over a mile to use the bathroom before. Being homeless would be far worse.",elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions]

I live in [ORGANIZATION] but spend a lot of time in [PERSON] (son there). I love [PERSON]. I have never seen a homeless person there. I know they are there but it's not like in GPE2 or [ORGANIZATION]. Everything is so affordable in [PERSON]! People are nice. Kids can do dual language in elementary school. The restaurants are wonderful. The mountains are beautiful. It's hot in [ORGANIZATION] but I get up early for my walk and the sunrise/sunsets are gorgeous. Always happy when I am there.,elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide an observation, express their opinion]

Yeah I once offered a homeless man a free meal. I'm an [ORGANIZATION] driver and I had a customer cancel so I had free food. He took one look at it and cursed me out and said he didn't want it.,elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide an observation, express their opinion, personal interaction]
