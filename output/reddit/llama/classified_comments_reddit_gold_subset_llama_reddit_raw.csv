The corner is always covered and it seems to rotate through a few of the same individuals, almost as if the are on shifts. I haven't heard much more than that, but I have heard the same thing from various people who work with homeless and/or addicts. I don't personally provide direct services or work with clients anymore so I haven't heard it myself but I trust those I have heard it from. Some were talking about trying to alert media or police to it but not sure that anyone has enough information to work with.

Reasoning: The speaker expresses their concern about a proposed development, citing concerns about the type of people who will be housed there.

"Not a big surprise?

There is not a lack of low paying jobs here. The top needs of the panhandlers is usually mental care, which we as a society really suck at providing.

Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: []
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter is asking if there's evidence that local police beat panhandlers with batons, and the tone implies skepticism. However, the phrase ""Because they don't"" seems to imply that the commenter assumes no such violence occurs, rather than genuinely seeking information. Therefore, I classify this as an ""Ask a Rhetorical Question"". A more accurate classification might be ""Express their Opinion"", as the commenter is expressing their assumption about the situation.

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/underserving]
racist: [Yes]
Reasoning: The commenter implies that panhandlers are addicted and involved with dealers, which perpetuates negative stereotypes about people experiencing homelessness. Additionally, the commenter suggests that providing low-cost housing and mental health facilities is a better solution, but frames it as a way to address the perceived problems of panhandlers rather than acknowledging the systemic issues contributing to homelessness. This language reinforces the notion that people experiencing homelessness are somehow ""deserving"" of assistance if they meet certain conditions (e.g., being willing to work), while others are not.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their personal experience and opinion about the struggles faced by homeless individuals, emphasizing the need for systemic change and support.

 Sentance: The city council has been doing nothing to address the growing number of homeless people in our community.  They're just passing the buck and letting the private sector handle it.  Meanwhile, the private sector is making a fortune off of these people's suffering.  It's disgusting.
Comment Type: [express their opinion]

Perception Type: [media portrayal]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter criticizes the city council's inaction and the private sector's profiteering from homelessness, presenting a negative view of both entities.

 Sentance: Homelessness is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach.  We need to address the root causes of homelessness, such as poverty, lack of affordable housing, and mental illness.  We also need to provide support services, such as job training and counseling, to help individuals get back on their feet.  And we need to hold accountable those who contribute to the problem, such as landlords who price out low-income families and corporations that prioritize profits over people.

Reasoning: The commenter is expressing the view that [ORGANIZATION] would likely distribute aid effectively, implying that other organizations might not. This implies a judgment about who is worthy of aid, which is a form of deserving/undeserving rhetoric. Additionally, the commenter's assumption that [ORGANIZATION] would only give aid to someone who truly needs it reinforces a negative stereotype about the effectiveness of aid distribution by other organizations.

"I experience the same comments with non-benders in my car. It's tough because we want [ORGANIZATION] to be better, and there's been large improvements. But there is still a [ORGANIZATION] of work to be done. At this point, I feel as if the homeless issue is starting to hold back development and other progress in the city, mainly downtown. I can't stress enough how delicate and sensitive of an issue this is for [ORGANIZATION]. Agree or not, we are a liberal city, with quite a few Democrats in charge. The bread of butter of Democrats is poor relief. Is the current situation a result of the current (local) administration/leaders? I mean, this doesn't happen overnight and is really a product of issues that effect the entire [PERSON] (is [ORGANIZATION] the only or select few with this problem? No). But here we are, with this issue in our laps. It doesn't matter so much as to how they got here. The real focus needs to be how to get them back onto their feet and self sufficient. There has been proven success with the housing first model. We don't have the capital to overnight the project and get results right away, so we are left in a holding pattern waiting for the first units to come online and gather data on how that works for us. 

I think this issue could actually be a fantastic opportunity for [ORGANIZATION] to step in. They have some of the brightest individuals there, that could use their resesrch expertise, and other knowledge to come with up with a collaborative approach with the City of [ORGANIZATION] to help tackle this problem the right [STREET].

However, they also imply that certain groups, such as those with mental health issues or addiction problems, may not deserve help, using phrases like ""the real focus needs to be how to get them back onto their feet and self-sufficient.""

Some are innocuous, such for example, [ORGANIZATION] doesn't allow pets, but [ORGANIZATION] does. [ORGANIZATION] is sex segregated so couples can't stay there together, but they can at [ORGANIZATION]. 

But the other big distinction is that [ORGANIZATION] isn't a low barrier shelter, so they have a strick drugs and alcohol policy, which [ORGANIZATION] does not.

When you haven’t been around people experiencing active homelessness and potentially untreated mental health issues it can be scary at first bc let’s be real… all the unknown things and situations in our lives are scary for the most part- positive or negative.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by stating that the original poster's question is ""so so so valid"" and that they're glad they asked it.

I already sent an email to [ORGANIZATION] (and I should probably send one to [PERSON] as well) requesting some more specifics on what the plan is to maintain the neighborhood. Id suggest you do the same. The more pressure, the better. When this happens, because it certainly sounds like its going to, we are going to have to try to make the most of it. We will have a vested interest in making sure the residents there succeed and receive the resources they are promised. We will also need to make sure we hold the city's feet to the fire to make sure they fulfill their promises to us and maintain our neighborhood. 

Thankfully this is a little different than a soup kitchen or shelter. Its actual housing, its designed for people who are maybe one step up from living on the streets, but still one step down from being on their feet enough to live in someplace like FAC0.

"There have been polls taken from people living under the viaduct, around downtown, etc. in [ORGANIZATION] showing that they won’t accept city help, either because they prefer living homeless or don’t trust the government, or both. I don’t know how a city is supposed to help these people, it seems like a lost cause. Mayor [PERSON] would even go to the homeless encampments In Person and talk to those living there - even with personal persuasion, he couldn’t get people to not want to live under that viaduct.

The truth is, [LOCATION] does have a lot of resources and options relative to our city size - it’s just a lot of homeless refuse to use them.",southbend,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation]

"The meeting was a great showing of varying community opinion. Went from [TIME].

\- PERSON0 got truly irate

\- PERSON1 (mayors office) got called out for unintentionally lying and providing partial information [ORGANIZATION] night to council. [TIME] before the meeting too.

\- The main guy from [ORGANIZATION] said FAC0 started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after [TIME] when there is no presence on site. Some lady from [ORGANIZATION] who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to [LOCATION] and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- [ORGANIZATION] got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until [TIME]) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- [ORGANIZATION] and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- PERSON2 of [ORGANIZATION] berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from ORG2 essentially said the same thing. [ORGANIZATION] also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes [TIME] the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which [ORGANIZATION] said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with [ORGANIZATION] apologized because they were voting against.

\- PERSON4 also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly [ORGANIZATION] employees, and people like PERSON4 who only took up [TIME] total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give [TIME] to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition [TIME]?

\- [ORGANIZATION] had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the [ORGANIZATION] project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the [STREET]. [ORGANIZATION] kept repeating they asked their consultant (DATE2) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as [ORGANIZATION] while giving numerous sites labels of [LOCATION]. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- PERSON6 tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter ([ORGANIZATION]) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""[INSTITUTION]"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. [ORGANIZATION] said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 [PERSON] meetings, 1 of which is attended. The [PERSON] barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in [ORGANIZATION] without a site in mind so then it became urgent in [LOCATION] to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around DATE4. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side? You going to find many free multiple acre properties in [PERSON]'s district?",southbend,"Comment Type: [express their opinion, express others opinions]

The comment discusses a meeting where various perspectives on a proposed homeless shelter were presented. The commenter criticizes the organization behind the proposal, [ORGANIZATION], for their lack of preparation, misrepresentation of facts, and discriminatory practices. They highlight instances where [ORGANIZATION] has been accused of lying, belittling opposing viewpoints, and discriminating against certain groups, including LGBTQ+ individuals. The commenter also notes that [ORGANIZATION] has been accused of manipulating public opinion and using emotional appeals to sway the council's decision. Overall, the commenter expresses their disapproval of [ORGANIZATION]'s actions and motives, suggesting that they are driven by a desire to exploit vulnerable populations rather than genuinely address the issue of homelessness. 

Note: The commenter explicitly states that they are a social worker and has experience working with [ORGANIZATION], adding credibility to their claims. However, the tone of the comment is critical and accusatory, indicating that the commenter is expressing their opinion rather than simply providing a neutral report."
"Yeah on my phone and trying to figure out how to share a [ORGANIZATION]. It's 20-22 units, they have leases, and some pay a small portion of rent but not usually. Originally (DATE0) it was a part time maintenance person, [TIME] a week apt/community manager, and [TIME] a week for a off-duty cop. RA may live on site but they would have to go to the state for approval, likely be difficult, and not in plans currently.

There would be on site visits from [ORGANIZATION] (recovery coach) but for their caseworker it sounds like they would pick up individuals and bring them to [ORGANIZATION]. Same for mental health and addiction services.  [ORGANIZATION] would have 2 case managers available, not solely dedicated. The homeless individual has the choice to participate.

Reasoning: The commenter is asking about the specifics of a proposed project, including its funding, staffing, and services provided. This suggests that they are genuinely interested in understanding the proposal and its potential impact. The mention of a recovery coach and case managers also implies that the commenter is familiar with the types of services typically provided by such organizations. The tone is informative and inquiring, rather than critical or dismissive.

 Sentance: I am a volunteer at a local soup kitchen and I see firsthand the struggles these people face every day.  We get a lot of regulars who come back every day, sometimes multiple times a day.  They're not lazy, they're struggling.  They need help and we do our best to give it to them.  But it's hard to see people being treated poorly by the system.  It's hard to see people being judged based on their appearance or their circumstances.  We try to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or situation.  But it's hard to see the world treating them that way.

Reasoning: The commenter is expressing their personal experience and perspective on the issue, highlighting the struggles faced by individuals experiencing homelessness and the need for compassion and understanding. However, the phrase ""they're not lazy"" could be interpreted as perpetuating a stereotype that people experiencing homelessness are somehow responsible for their situation. Additionally, the commenter's emphasis on the importance of treating everyone with dignity and respect may be seen as overly simplistic or naive. Overall, while the commenter is attempting to convey empathy and understanding, their language and tone may inadvertently reinforce negative stereotypes or assumptions about people experiencing homelessness.

## Step 1: Analysis of the first comment
Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: []
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The speaker asks if there is any implication that local police beat panhandlers with batons, which suggests a genuine inquiry into the situation. However, the phrase ""they don't"" implies a lack of evidence or confirmation, making it more likely that the comment type is ""ask a rhetorical question"".

## Step 2: Analysis of the second comment
Comment Type: [express their opinion, express others opinions]
Critique Category: []
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [not in my backyard, harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The speaker expresses their concern about a proposed facility housing drug addicts and people with mental issues near a school, suggesting that they believe these individuals are undeserving of assistance. The use of phrases such as ""it usually is"" and ""*Drug addicts and people with mental issues*"" also implies a negative stereotype about homeless individuals.

## Step 3: Analysis of the third comment
Comment Type: [ask a rhetorical question, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [not in my backyard, harmful generalization]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The speaker asks a rhetorical question about the need for pots and pans for homeless individuals, which is meant to highlight the perceived absurdity of providing material goods to those in need. The tone is sarcastic and dismissive, implying that homeless individuals are somehow responsible for their own circumstances.

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter implies that certain cities are worse off than [ORGANIZATION] due to the presence of brutal institutions, which may be a reference to prisons or psychiatric hospitals. This comparison suggests a negative stereotype about cities with such institutions, implying that they are more prone to homelessness. Additionally, the use of the word ""brutal"" to describe these institutions reinforces a negative perception of these cities and their treatment of homeless individuals. 

The second part of the sentence also contains a judgment about the deservingness of homeless individuals, as the commenter states that [ORGANIZATION] does not have it ""nearly as bad"" as other cities, implying that other cities are more deserving of criticism. 

Overall, the commenter's language and tone convey a sense of superiority towards [ORGANIZATION] and a negative attitude towards cities with institutions that are perceived as harsher. This classification as racist is based on the implication that certain groups of people (those living in cities with brutal institutions) are inherently less worthy of sympathy or assistance."
"I’ve lived downtown for [ORGANIZATION] and see homeless people sleeping in my parking lot on benches, setting up tents by the river and sleeping, just trying to be comfortable somewhere. I think it is ridiculous to act like providing homeless people housing would somehow increase crime when we know that evidence shows providing stable living environments brings DOWN crime. I would much rather live next door to a housing facility for the homeless than continue to see people sleeping on the bare ground. The same people who complain about the amount of homeless people are the same ones who complain whenever the city does anything to try to assist them. It’s ridiculous. we shouldn’t listen to these people because they will complain no matter what because at [DATE], they just like to look down on others",southbend,"Comment Type: [express their opinion, provide a fact or claim]

To the point of something outside the city, good luck getting the county to agree to that. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] hate homeless people to the point of calling them garbage.

This type of language perpetuates negative stereotypes and stigmatizes the homeless, indicating a harmful generalization. Additionally, the commenter's assumption that the homeless encampment would be a burden on the community suggests that they believe the homeless are undeserving of assistance or support.

Reasoning: The commenter implies that certain institutions, such as the [INSTITUTION], are responsible for perpetuating negative stereotypes about homeless individuals, specifically those who are perceived as being ""deserving"" of assistance. This is evident in the use of phrases such as ""hope ministries,"" which may be seen as stigmatizing or judgmental towards those seeking help.

"I like some of his ideas but I have a better chance being a pro basketball player than [ORGANIZATION] does consolidating departments or initiatives with [PERSON]. Him thinking that's possible makes me question if he's just saying that to get away with the ""how will you pay for this"" question than it either shows willful misleading or not understanding the dynamic between the two cities.

He seems to be trying to be the best of both worlds and say ""hey if you like [ORGANIZATION] and where the city is going I'm your guy but also hey [ORGANIZATION] is overrated and the city needs a lot of work"" it's an interesting strategy.

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter mentions several locations where food is provided, which could be seen as helpful. However, they also mention an organization that has been criticized for its discriminatory practices towards LGBTQ+ individuals, including trans individuals. This suggests that the commenter holds negative views about certain groups of people experiencing homelessness, such as trans individuals. Furthermore, the commenter's tone implies that these individuals may not deserve help or support. 

Note: The commenter does not explicitly state that trans individuals are ""deserving"" or ""undeserving,"" but the context and tone suggest that they hold a negative view of these individuals. Therefore, I classified this comment as containing racist sentiment."

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a death due to the cold, which implies that the organization's failure to provide adequate shelter led to the death. This suggests a critical view of the organization's handling of homelessness, which aligns with a government critique category. Additionally, the commenter uses phrases such as ""this isn't a good look"" and ""deserving/undeserving"", which imply a judgment about the individual's circumstances, consistent with a perception type of harmful generalization and deserving/underserving. Furthermore, the use of the word ""sold"" in the context of a homeless person dying of the cold implies a negative stereotype about homeless individuals being disposable or unvalued, which is a characteristic of racist language.

Reasoning: The commenter downplays the significance of the issue by stating that it's only a few dozen people, which dismisses the concerns of others. This response can be seen as dismissive and unsympathetic, which aligns with a perception type of not in my backyard. The phrase ""it's not like we're talking about a large-scale crisis"" also implies a lack of empathy or understanding for the struggles faced by homeless individuals, which is a characteristic of a societal critique.

Reasoning: The comment implies that homeless people are somehow less worthy or deserving of basic human dignity if they cannot afford to purchase items themselves. This kind of thinking perpetuates negative stereotypes and stigmatizes individuals experiencing homelessness. Furthermore, the suggestion that someone should ""buy"" and ""convert"" these items into housing reinforces a paternalistic attitude towards homeless individuals, implying that they need external intervention rather than addressing the root causes of homelessness.

Reasoning: The commenter provides a fact about the warming shelters being available and the reasons behind the lack of new facilities. This suggests a nuanced understanding of the issue. However, the phrase ""many homeless individuals are 'choosing' not to stay there often because of their habit"" implies judgment on the part of the commenter, which could be seen as stigmatizing. Additionally, the mention of ""NIMBYism"" and the implication that there is no suitable location for a new facility may perpetuate negative stereotypes about certain groups of people.

Reasoning: The commenter explicitly states their opinion by using phrases such as ""symptom of a larger systemic issue"" and ""addressing the root cause."" They also use a clear call-to-action (""focusing on addressing the root cause"") which indicates their perspective on the issue. The phrase ""treating the symptoms"" is likely a criticism of current approaches to addressing homelessness, suggesting that the commenter believes there is a more comprehensive solution needed. The reference to media portrayal (the commenter framing homelessness as a symptom of a larger issue) implies that they are aware of the public perception of homelessness and are trying to challenge it.

Reasoning: The commenter implies that the current approach to addressing homelessness is ineffective and wasteful, suggesting that officer man-hours and equipment could be better spent on providing aid. However, the tone of the comment also implies that the homeless are somehow responsible for being homeless (""still homeless but now exposed to the elements""), which is a form of blaming the victim. This language is characteristic of a harmful generalization, and the commenter's suggestion that aid should only go to certain groups of people (implied by the phrase ""the homeless"") reinforces this idea. Furthermore, the commenter's assumption that the homeless are ""deserving"" of aid is problematic, as it ignores the complex issues surrounding homelessness and the need for comprehensive solutions. Overall, the commenter's language and assumptions reveal a racist attitude towards the homeless."

"So, I've changed a lot on this one over time. I spent [ORGANIZATION] as an advocate working against chronic homelessness, have participated on some of the city's [LOCATION] on homelessness, etc, but I don't think the city, nor this take are being entirely generous.

It [LOCATION] - but... housing first doesn't give free license to do housing first poorly. there are ways to do zero barrier in ways that are more harmful and less harmful.3 - less harmful = scattered site. less harmful = day shelter programming and a more controlled check in/check out process. more harmful = large complexes. more harmful (to the community) = no day programming, free roaming, full freedom, full visitation (allows for drug dealers)4 - Motels4Now has been good for the homeless, but harmful for many near it. It just has. Businesses have closed, people feel less safe, and it decreases the dignity and pride of the people near it (who - as those on the [ORGANIZATION] side - have already dealt with a lot of disinvestment). I'm not sure it's fair to help some people by harming some others, especially when it's just due to not being willing to produce the funding to do it in a [STREET] that is even more helpful and less harmful.I think at this point my preference would be something outside of city limits, on the edge of town where there's still zero restrictions on sobriety, but still a more programmatic or controlled environment. And let's pay for a shuttle that can connect people to the bus line. Surely a small shuttle bus and a full-time driver is within financial reason, given the total project will cost millions anyway.

I'm not saying my idea is the best one. But we at least have to have some compassion for the real expressed needs of neighbors and business owners without painting them out to be petty or greedy.

"The volunteering has bothered me for quite a while like you said, these people cannot even feed let  alone house themselves yet they’re down there donating their time which could be better spent looking for a job. Now the situation is so dire that a food train is needed to feed these volunteers. Again, wouldn’t they be better served finding a job?

We’re talking about people who are in the throes of their addiction, in the middle of detoxing, or fresh out of rehab or suffering from mental illness . Of course if she asked them to take a picture of video they’re going to say yes, they feel obligated to say yes, would be my guess, some of them probably feel like if they don’t say yes, she won’t help them, or they won’t be able to be down there ,or worse be ostracized once again in their lives. .

"Pretty strong rhetoric here. [ORGANIZATION] administers both homeless prevention assistance and housing assistance for thousands of people [ORGANIZATION]. And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. [ORGANIZATION] literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at [TIME] to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG2 does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

I'm very sorry to hear that you're having a hard time keeping up with building codes. I hope that you can make the adjustments required for you to continue helping people in a [STREET] that's safe, and I hope that you're able to continue to increase what you do for the community.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on supporting organizations that are homophobic, citing personal experience as a social worker. They also express others' opinions by mentioning the struggles of GLBTQIA+ and trans individuals in the organization. However, the tone is critical towards certain groups, labeling them as ""homophobic"" and stating that they should get over certain issues. This criticism is directed at a specific group, which may be perceived as discriminatory. Despite this, the commenter does not explicitly use derogatory language or make overtly racist statements, making the classification ""No"". Nevertheless, the tone and content suggest that the commenter holds negative views towards certain groups, which could be considered harmful generalizations. 

The commenter also implies that certain individuals are undeserving of support due to their sexual orientation or gender identity, which aligns with the perception type ""deserving/undeserving"". However, this aspect is not as prominent as the criticism directed towards the organization's alleged homophobia. Overall, the commenter's tone and language contribute to a perception of harm and exclusion, even if the intent is not necessarily malicious."

"I don't agree; I think it's an effective measurement of our effort. It never meant you could not find someone camping out in [ORGANIZATION] or avoiding/antagonizing the continuing care system.

All the connected services would agree that homelessness has become worse since [ORGANIZATION], or at least the ones I keep up with.",rockford,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation]

"[PERSON] the books is a semantical term, It’s reflects a pattern of [DATE] they are rich and thriving and the next in a crises (the city basically refuses to admit it’s a rust belt city caught in the grip of global capitalism), as for [ORGANIZATION] it was more about [ORGANIZATION] than race. [ORGANIZATION] does need to get more [ORGANIZATION] in leadership but so does the Government. The unions could have met the diversity requirements requested by the developers but the developer did that to split the vote over the ORG1. I could go on [ORGANIZATION] about [ORGANIZATION] but will spare the sub. I really wish they woulda focused on creating affordable housing rather than luxury units and honestly wish they woulda worked out the deal with ORG2.

Honestly lots of times announcements like this lead to nowhere or we forget about it. I will agree that corruption is legalized in a lot of ways. The reality is it’s very difficult to ascertain what is going on. Is the city doing well or not? It doesn’t feel like it often but I do like the people of [ORGANIZATION] that work hard to make it work, I just don’t think that “thriving” in the [STREET] the current administration wants it to be should be the goal. The goal should be to make sure that everybody is able to get equal access to resources. The difference between east and west [PERSON] is glaring.",rockford,"Comment Type: [express their opinion, express others opinions]
Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on the situation, referencing the lack of affordable housing and the focus on luxury units. They also mention the difficulties in assessing the city's performance and the importance of ensuring equal access to resources.

This indicates that they are expressing others' opinions, likely due to their experience as a social worker and their awareness of the issues affecting marginalized communities.

Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter uses phrases such as ""more professional beggars"" and implies that certain groups of people are more deserving of attention or sympathy than others. This language suggests a negative stereotype about homeless individuals, particularly those who are perceived as more visible or assertive on the streets. Furthermore, the commenter's assertion that there are fewer homeless individuals now may be based on a biased perception, rather than objective evidence. Overall, the tone and language used by the commenter convey a sense of disdain and judgment towards homeless individuals, which is characteristic of racist attitudes."
"No, that's not it at all and that's absolutely misconstruing my concern.  Homeless funds are limited.  We can take care of OUR homeless because our grant distributions are based on our population.  [ORGANIZATION] gets tens of millions of dollars and their response is to ship people to places with fewer resources.  Look up ORG0 Continuum of Care funding and you'll be appalled at how much money they get and that this is their solution.  

I don't oppose helping the homeless.  They are people as well and people need help. I oppose ""helping"" them by making them someone else's responsibility to help when you're given literally all of the resources to help them yourselves.",rockford,"Comment Type: [express their opinion]
Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on the topic of homelessness, specifically criticizing the way grants are distributed and the approach taken by organizations like ORG0. They also mention that they do not oppose helping the homeless, but rather the way it is being done. This suggests that they believe the current system is flawed and that resources should be allocated more effectively. The commenter uses phrases such as ""we can take care of OUR homeless"" which implies a sense of ownership and responsibility, and criticizes the idea of shipping people to other areas with fewer resources. This perception type is classified as ""harmful generalization"" because the commenter assumes that people who receive assistance are somehow less capable or deserving of help than others. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the commenter holds any discriminatory views towards homeless individuals themselves, but rather towards the system and approach used to address the issue. 

The commenter also mentions that they are a social worker, which adds credibility to their perspective and suggests that they have first-hand experience with the issue. Overall, the tone of the comment is critical and concerned, rather than dismissive or derogatory towards homeless individuals."
"News Flash, the roads are open, you can leave anytime. ""Stuck here because of FAC0"" was a thing for [ORGANIZATION], now if you are stuck its because you choose to be.

Also, the city does put some people into hotels, what qualifies a person for that program?  I know [ORGANIZATION] had to participate in the City's [ORGANIZATION] process per her [ORGANIZATION], and she hasn't done that yet per the city citations. Is it because there aren't really that many ""new"" homeless people as she claims, or they are already in the system and she wants to shield them if that process requires her to log an encounter.

Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [media portrayal, perception type not specified]

Reasoning: The commenter asks several questions about the organization's operations, including how they handle overflow, hotel placement, and the city's process for tracking homeless individuals. This suggests a desire to understand the inner workings of the organization and its relationship with the city. The tone is inquiring rather than confrontational, indicating a genuine interest in learning more.

"PERSON0 speaks badly of other NFPs in [ORGANIZATION]. She makes up stories about them. She has a HUGE ego. A lot of the homeless she helped didn’t want to follow the rules of [ORGANIZATION] Rescue Mission and FAC0. So Miss PERSON0’s was a collection of misfits. Then she let the misfits be In charge of the back Donation space.

Furthermore, the commenter accuses PERSON0 of letting misfits take control of the donation space, which could be seen as perpetuating a narrative that homeless individuals are incapable of managing resources effectively. Overall, the tone and language used convey a sense of disdain towards homeless individuals and imply that they are somehow less worthy of assistance than others.

"A lot of people commenting are assuming the people she's helping have a phone and can call for help themselves. Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss [PERSON]'s bc they know she has [LOCATION] and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break. 

I am not saying that there is or isn't a reason to be concerned, I don't know either [STREET], but some of the comments are petty [ORGANIZATION]. She's asking for immediate donations of food, shows the lack of food and the line of people and when the food is delivered they see the hungry people. She goes live all the time and shows the volunteers, donations and those she's helping. I think she is helping them and that those complaining or questioning haven't proven otherwise. 

I don't see anyone else in the neighborhood helping our most vulnerable residents 24/7 with a sack lunch and no questions asked. Everyone deserves and needs food to survive.",rockford,"Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions]

Reasoning: 
The commenter starts by addressing concerns about people not having phones to call for help, highlighting the importance of nonprofits accepting old cellphones as donations. This demonstrates a genuine attempt to understand the complexities of homelessness. The commenter then provides observations about the culture within homeless communities, including mistrust of authorities and the importance of building relationships for acceptance of help. This shows a nuanced understanding of the issue.

Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: This commenter expresses their opinion by stating that [ORGANIZATION] is exploiting a homeless woman at her worst. They also reference another user's comment, which further supports their opinion. The commenter believes that [ORGANIZATION] is enabling addicts, which suggests a negative view of the organization's approach. Additionally, the commenter uses language that implies the woman is a victim, such as ""at her worst"", which reinforces the perception that the woman is undeserving of help. The use of the phrase ""exploiting"" also contains racial bias, as it implies that the organization is taking advantage of a vulnerable individual, likely a person of color. 

The commenter also makes a solution-oriented comment, suggesting that the organization should focus on helping individuals overcome addiction rather than simply providing aid. However, this suggestion is made in the context of criticizing the organization's current approach, rather than offering a genuinely helpful alternative. Overall, the commenter's tone is critical and judgmental, and their language reflects a negative stereotype about homeless individuals."

Reasoning: The commenter provides information about the organization's phone number and its role in providing emergency housing. This suggests that the commenter has knowledge about the organization's services and operations. However, the tone of the response implies that the commenter believes that the organization is inaccessible or unhelpful, which could be seen as a criticism of the organization's effectiveness. Furthermore, the suggestion that the best course of action is for individuals to seek employment and temporary housing before seeking assistance from the organization reinforces a narrative that those who are struggling are somehow responsible for their situation, rather than acknowledging systemic barriers to access. This type of language can perpetuate negative stereotypes about people experiencing homelessness."

Please excuse my sarcasm and my bad dry jokes my humor I love to go sense of humor and a bad bad joke set [ORGANIZATION] but I am indeed just trying to keep this light because I really don't know what the problem is I have lived in [ORGANIZATION] for [DATE] and I just recently heard about Miss [PERSON]'s and maybe [ORGANIZATION] and I haven't heard anything but very good things about the establishment and her in general but again I mentioned personal experiencing I don't have to go into detail cuz it doesn't really matter but I I was helped greatly by Miss [PERSON] and never having met her in my entire life nor had she met me and I know that putting this down here but I bet you're wrong and I'm pretty transparent if anybody wants to know they can ask very easy to send somebody in private message but you know I'm not going to throw it out there it doesn't matter if I'm just going to say it's not I'm guessing it's probably not what you think unless you somehow or never mind whoever you I'm speaking of generally like whoever it is that has these issues and problems against Miss [PERSON] personally or Miss [PERSON]'s and in general I'm just curious I'd like to know why you taking such an interest in doing this and I wonder if it was you that had something to do with shut getting there needle exchange and shut down or any of the other things that help people that aren't perfect or that do things that you don't like I don't know I think that what my problem is more than anything else doesn't matter who it is or where it is or who these people are who you are who any thing related to whatever it is take what is is it your job to do this I just am wondering like again I'm going to say I'm just so curious as to what made you dislike the [STREET] so much that you're going to sit there and you're going to as far as I know slender I don't know that any of this is true I'd like to see your proof but I guess again I don't know anything about this and I'm just my anger is in the fact of that it's things like this that have the world set to where it is right now thank God you can't quit feeling things for [PERSON]'s sake hey come leave people alone is what I mean keep feeling it's the one [STREET] or another about things you don't like maybe your life would be a little bit happier but definitely like my mom would say leave people the f alone right I say quit feeling others just say let you I also noticed that you put down all of those things that must have took some time to get all that information and everything I sure hope that you're right about all of them and I'll end right now because I'm getting so irritated and going on and thinking about this but I noticed there wasn't anything I put out as far as how many meals have been served how many homeless people have been housed how many people have gotten to go to rehabilitation services that otherwise wouldn't have . How many rides have been given how many people have closed that didn't have clothes hygiene supplies that didn't have supplies if this [STREET] gets shut down are you going to help the people or you know complain more that there's people on the corners asking for money while you're complaining to get the places to help them shut down.

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: This comment contains both expressions of opinion and references to others' opinions. The author criticizes the actions of someone who is perceived to be targeting Miss [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] without providing evidence. The author also expresses frustration and irritation towards the situation, which suggests that they hold strong opinions about the topic. However, the tone remains somewhat defensive and sarcastic, indicating that the author is trying to justify their perspective rather than genuinely engage with opposing viewpoints. The mention of personal experience and the desire to understand the motivations behind the criticism suggest that the author is attempting to humanize the situation and avoid being seen as overly confrontational. Overall, the comment appears to be a mix of expressing opinions and referencing others' perspectives, with a focus on critiquing societal attitudes towards homelessness. 

The comment does not contain any overtly racist language or sentiment, making the ""racist"" category ""No"". The perception type ""harmful generalization"" is applicable due to the author's criticism of the target individual and organization without providing evidence or context. The perception type ""deserving/undeserving"" is also relevant, as the author implies that the target individual and organization are undeserving of support or attention."
"I will try to save everyone [TIME] of their life by summarizing the Live video.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed a few complaints on her fb page.  First, she addressed the gal who expressed frustration of clothes, personal care bags, food, razors, feminine products being dumped around her home.  The woman asked miss [ORGANIZATION] volunteers to come pick it up since it’s a regular problem.  [ORGANIZATION] addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets [ORGANIZATION] while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.  That doesn’t happen anymore,  but instead it became the neighbors problem.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at [ORGANIZATION]’s a few times and was angry at how she wasn’t helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed it saying it’s because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers aren’t sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her [STREET] is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is [ORGANIZATION] register [ORGANIZATION] may turn out to be a blessing for her, per [ORGANIZATION] (not in those words).  She can’t comment on the article per the board, but so many people have offered support since the article so these things may get addressed by volunteers in the community.  I feel so bad for these businesses being sucked into this when the economy hasn’t been the best for all lines of business.  Do they know she raised $400k for a $175k building?  I also felt bad for the Mexican restaurant donating so many meals DATE2.  I hope the food goes to those that need it, but cash flow at restaurants has been tough since [PERSON] and inflation.  But, I suppose they consider it advertisement.",rockford,"Comment Type: [express their opinion, express others opinions]

"1) Its close to [ORGANIZATION]. I love that its really quick to jump on the highway and be there in [TIME] or so. housing is less expensive

2) I hate the crime and gang violence that spills out of the west side of [PERSON]. it also acts like a catch all for the riff raff coming out of [ORGANIZATION]. the homeless is a growing issue too. 

The roads are crap because you get the worst of [ORGANIZATION] being down well below 0 for [LOCATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] are well above the 90s for [LOCATION]. the springs and falls are nice but its [ORGANIZATION] of each. 

[PERSON] is also a highly industrial area, except that was [PERSON]. alot of empty rusted dilapidated buildings that hipsters start a business in for [PERSON] then go under.

this area is extremely blue collar, the only thing that they like to do is go to bars. Not really a music or art culture here. just bars. 

people here cant [STREET] worth a shit. guys in [ORGANIZATION] are still wearing skater shoes with chain wallets. Moms smoke in their cars with their babies listening to papa roach. 

since they passed a gambling law, there are slots on every corner and in every [STREET] imaginable. They also passed another granting [PERSON] to build a casino [PERSON] or DATE8. So the people that live paycheck to paycheck that already have problems can go to surrender what they have left. But the city gets a bit of the profit, which you'll never see get implemented to benifit you in any [STREET]

3) I wish [PERSON] had one [STREET] that wasnt constantly covered in trash.

4) I would vist the surrounding towns in [PERSON], or even GPE2. but each town will have its own challenges. like when a chemical tool plants explodes and burns for [ORGANIZATION]#x200B;

Final thoughts: You might need to reconsider what youre willing to sacrifice for what you hope to gain. The [ORGANIZATION] is just one big cornfield of poverty. Im personally biased in that I hope a nuclear bomb goes off in this city. I would say that maybe just rent for [LOCATION]0 to experience the seasons and they [STREET] people act like here. Sure we dont have [ORGANIZATION] like you do in [LOCATION], but we have plenty of suicidal alcoholic domestic abusers that fly their freak flag here. So its a trade off. If you do decide to move here, make sure you lock your doors at [TIME] and chain down what you dont want stolen.

Reasoning: The commenter asks a question about the location of the ""bad side of town"" which implies that there may be areas where homeless people congregate due to substance abuse or other negative behaviors. This language suggests that the commenter has preconceived notions about the demographics of homeless individuals and assumes that certain groups are more likely to engage in illicit activities. Furthermore, the commenter's assertion that the area is free of drug-selling activity and that homeless people hide in bushes on railroad tracks perpetuates negative stereotypes about homeless individuals. The commenter also calls for reporting the situation to an organization, which could potentially lead to further marginalization of the individual in question. Overall, the commenter exhibits racist tendencies through their language and assumptions."
"The city has been practicing the [ORGANIZATION] program for [ORGANIZATION].  What housing first does is provide shelter first, and then addresses the person's other issues.  The city also put a lot of people up in rooms during [PERSON] because they got funding for it.  It makes no sense that [ORGANIZATION] would pay for people's rent. The city has been so successful with [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] is a model for other cities.  The city also collaborates with other agencies to reduce overlap and gaps.  However, the city employees can't post on social media about what they do.  [ORGANIZATION] rarely speaks of the work and programs of the city and other agencies.  

It isn't compassionate to supply people to live rough indefinitely, and put a strain on community spaces when bedding, tents, clothing, and food waste are dumped and abandoned buildings go up in flames.  It is reckless to give people hope that they can live sustainably with a cup of ramen, a few blankets and a tent in [LOCATION].  That is why no other agency in town provided materials to live outdoors, they provide shelter first.  However, the city can't force anyone to accept help, so there will always be un-sheltered people.

"Most of those funds go to programs for housing and homeless prevention.They, for a while, also could go towards temporarily sheltering people. So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for [ORGANIZATION], or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for [LOCATION].  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in [STREET], and certain things that these funds simply can't help with. 

Then there's a couple programs that help people pay utility bills, but those are usually paid for with funds that are separate from what I was talking about before.",rockford,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation]

Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter implies that half of the homeless population is not genuinely homeless but rather exploiting others for financial gain. This statement perpetuates negative stereotypes about people experiencing homelessness, suggesting they are somehow undeserving of assistance due to their perceived motivations. 

The second part of the comment also contains a subtle racist undertone, as it assumes that certain groups are more likely to engage in such exploitative behaviors without providing evidence or context. This assumption reinforces harmful biases against marginalized communities.

 """"""I was at the shelter last night and saw a guy who had been living on the streets for years. He's got a disability and has been struggling with addiction. He's not a threat to anyone. He's just a human being who needs help. We should be focusing on providing him with the resources he needs, not stigmatizing him or making assumptions about his character. We need to stop treating people with disabilities and addiction as if they're less than us. We need to treat them with dignity and respect.

Reasoning: The commenter identifies themselves as a social worker working at PERSON, indicating they have expertise in addressing homelessness. However, they also express frustration with the current system's inability to address root causes, suggesting a critique of government policies and societal structures. This indicates a desire for systemic change rather than simply providing individual solutions. The mention of criminalizing homelessness addiction and poverty highlights a concern for the impact of policy on vulnerable populations. The use of phrases like ""the problem"" and ""that's not the problem"" implies a sense of frustration with the status quo, which may be perceived as dismissive of certain groups' struggles. This could be seen as a form of harmful generalization, assuming that everyone experiencing homelessness is equally culpable or deserving of help. The commenter's emphasis on structural assistance suggests they believe that addressing underlying issues is key to resolving the crisis. Overall, the tone is critical of the existing system while advocating for change, indicating a nuanced perspective on the issue."

Wealth is not directly correlated with expendable time. The wealthiest people I’ve met and know are some of the busiest people I’ve ever met. They’re always on call and always working. Now that’s not to say the people around them not earning it but enjoying the fruits of the labor don’t have expendable time. There are developers that are building apartments for low income but it’s not at a pace that can keep up with the issue. The creamery and the development on FAC0 for example.

"This is what I came to say, we are a city surrounded by a lot of rural areas.  If folks need supports, there is very little to be had in small towns.  It’s natural they would go where they can find assistance.  I don’t think magnet is the right term, though.

By the [STREET], most folks who are unhoused are not actually living on the streets or other public places.  Most are doubled-up with friends or family members, or living in motels/hotels.  Also, while we have resources available, we don’t have enough.

"Yeah, but specifically how? 

Tax rates for the wealthy are going down, not up. As you've seen in [ORGANIZATION] now, passing anything, even with democrats in power, is nearly impossible. Including tax hikes (fun fact: the bill being debated right now - is more than 25% tax cuts. As in the infrastructure bill is more than 25% tax cuts. And the Democrats are...in power, not the Republicans).

People always have simple answers to big problems, and these simple answers solve none of the problems. It is actually.... probably the saddest thing I've witnessed, in general over my life. 

We've said we would solve so much. Climate change, gun violence, equality, social mobility - and we've made zero progress on any of these. We've made negative progress, even. We can't even legalize marijuana at the federal level. 

Here's a simple solution to solving climate change; just do it. Just do it. Easy, right?

People on this subreddit keep asking the same questions, and providing the same simple answers. And yet they are amazed that they are unsatisfied with the results. Here's what the people asking these questions don't want to hear; invite the homeless in to your house. Or take your paycheck, and buy a house for the homeless person, or buy the homeless person a [ORGANIZATION] at a hotel. These are actual solutions that any of us can do. It just takes sacrifice from us. How many of us do you see making these sacrifices? None.

These statements reflect a critical perspective on certain aspects of homelessness and society, which falls under both government critique and societal critique categories. The commenter also offers suggestions for solutions, such as encouraging people to take advantage of available resources and promoting positive behaviors.

We are animals that have lived in the condition that appears before us. Somehow, miraculously, we have managed to transform things to where most people have homes and don’t starve. Cancer is on the upswing, but it’s mostly because we cured gangrene so [ORGANIZATION] people live long enough to get cancer. Our lives keep getting better. Yeah we don’t have things perfect yet, boo hoo. If our technology keeps progressing at the rate it has been, we could fairly soon create a society that has a universal basic income because of automation. Even still, you would have people that are just spiteful, hateful, cruel, lazy and deceitful. All societies have their faults, because they are hobbled together by imperfect creatures. This is the human condition, not the American condition. Insisting that you can’t wait for humanity to end isn’t indicative of a faulty society, it’s indicative of a faulty psyche. You fail to recognize how fucked up humanity has had it through time compared to how good life is [ORGANIZATION]. Remember, our ancestors lived in caves and were regularly prayed upon. I would highly recommend you get off [ORGANIZATION] and look up some of the positive things that have happened in [LOCATION]. Read some history books.

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter presents a philosophical argument that challenges the notion that homelessness is a moral failing or a personal choice. Instead, they frame it as a natural part of human existence, citing historical examples and technological advancements that suggest humanity's overall well-being is improving. However, they also acknowledge that there will always be flaws and imperfections in society, and that recognizing these flaws does not necessarily mean that the entire system is flawed. The tone is critical of those who insist on waiting for humanity to ""end"" rather than working towards improvement.

Note: The commenter uses phrases such as ""humanity's default state,"" ""we haven't chosen to 'create' this existence,"" and ""the human condition"" to emphasize that homelessness is not a personal failing, but rather a natural aspect of being human. This language can be seen as dismissive of individual agency and responsibility, which may lead to criticisms of the commenter's view as overly pessimistic or fatalistic.

"> No, giving them a home is a fundamental part of ending homelessness. 99.9999% of homeless people don't want to be homeless

Why don't you start with a room then? Perhaps your room? You can crash on the couch and there's only a 1 in 1 million chance that things won't work out.

Which everyone, even you, knows is bullshit. 

 [PERSON] is not caused by a lack of affordable housing.  It IS caused by addiction and mental illness. That accounts for 95-99% of homelessness. 

Abolition of capitalism? Says you, who thinks slavery, destruction, genocide, and oppression aren't bad things. 

But, I'm willing to be shown that your alternative to capitalism is better.  You're an avowed communist?  OK, go to a [INSTITUTION] and for every person there, divide your [DATE] wages equally amongst all.  If there are 15, divide by 16, so you get your share.

Reasoning: The user explicitly states that communism has killed over 100 million people, which is a well-documented historical fact. However, the tone and language used are highly critical and dismissive towards those who advocate for communism, labeling them as ""incredibly stupid"" or ""incredibly evil"". This kind of rhetoric is characteristic of racist and xenophobic discourse, particularly against marginalized groups such as communists, socialists, and left-leaning individuals. The user also makes a sweeping generalization about people who advocate for communism, implying that they are driven by malicious intentions rather than a genuine desire to improve society. Overall, the comment contains explicit and implicit racial bias, targeting individuals who hold progressive or socialist views."

The last thing we need is another [INSTITUTION] that turns people away because of their addiction, the addiction that is the root of the issue. 

When you fall into homelessness you lose everything you are, you start behaving differently than you would in a safe situation. When you have nothing to do [ORGANIZATION] and nothing to live for and just barely existing in life, of course you fall into drug use. Nobody is perfect and it's almost forced onto you. As someone who formerly lived on the streets, addiction is where you start and how you help people. Loving people even when they do relapse and offering help at [TIME] with no judgment and not taking the route of abstinence in every single situation.

Reasoning: 
The commenter expresses their opinion on the importance of rehabilitation programs and mental health facilities without involving churches. They also share their personal experience of falling into addiction while living on the streets, providing a fact or claim about the root cause of addiction. Additionally, they offer observations about the consequences of losing one's identity while experiencing homelessness and the importance of loving and helping people despite their struggles. The commenter critiques the current system by mentioning institutions that turn people away due to addiction, which falls under government critique. Furthermore, they discuss the need for non-judgmental support and solutions, aligning with societal critique. The commenter proposes solutions such as rehabilitation programs and mental health facilities, indicating a response category of solutions/interventions. Finally, the commenter criticizes the notion of judging people who fall into addiction, suggesting that they may be deserving of help rather than being undeserving. This perception type highlights the commenter's concern for the well-being of individuals struggling with addiction."

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [media portrayal]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter mentions the difficulty of quantifying the effectiveness of a proposed solution, which suggests they are considering the practical challenges of implementing such a program. This indicates a thoughtful and data-driven approach, rather than a simplistic or emotional response. Additionally, the commenter notes the failure of previous school millage proposals, suggesting they are aware of the complexities of raising funds for social programs. Overall, the tone is measured and analytical, indicating a genuine attempt to understand the issue and propose potential solutions. 

The second sentence seems to suggest that the commenter believes that increasing taxes for education is unlikely to succeed, which may imply that they believe that addressing homelessness will also face similar challenges. However, this is not explicitly stated, and the focus remains on the difficulties of quantifying the effectiveness of a proposed solution. 

Overall, the commenter appears to be approaching the topic with a critical and nuanced perspective, taking into account the complexities of funding and implementation. This suggests that the commenter is genuinely seeking to understand the issue and propose effective solutions, rather than simply expressing a personal opinion or making inflammatory statements. 

Therefore, the commenter's comment is classified as providing a fact or claim, asking a genuine question, and critiquing the government's approach to solving the problem, while also acknowledging the challenges of implementing any solution."

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by stating that certain individuals are ""nightmares"" and have caused problems in shared living spaces. They also imply that these individuals are responsible for their own homelessness due to their inability to ""live with other people."" This language perpetuates negative stereotypes about people experiencing homelessness, particularly those with mental health issues or addiction. The commenter's tone suggests that they believe these individuals are somehow ""deserving"" of being homeless, reinforcing harmful generalizations about people experiencing homelessness. Furthermore, the commenter's use of phrases such as ""eternally be homeless"" implies a lack of empathy and understanding for the complex issues surrounding homelessness. Overall, the commenter's language and tone demonstrate a clear example of racist sentiment."

You mentioned properties being “over priced” but people [ORGANIZATION] said the same thing, and it just keeps rising. If you want to help the homeless, go out and spend your hard earned money on a home and rent it out to them for below market value.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by stating that if someone wants to help the homeless, they should buy a property and rent it out at below market value. This implies that the commenter believes that the current system is flawed and that individual action can solve the problem. The commenter also expresses others' opinions by referencing a previous conversation where people claimed that properties were ""overpriced"" and that the issue was not being addressed. However, the tone of the response suggests that the commenter is criticizing the lack of effort from others to address the issue, rather than genuinely seeking solutions. The perception type is harmful generalization because the commenter assumes that everyone who doesn't want to buy a property and rent it out is unwilling to help the homeless, which is a negative stereotype. The commenter also makes a judgment about deservingness, implying that only certain types of people (those who are willing to buy and rent out properties) deserve help.

I think in [ORGANIZATION] ( lived there for [ORGANIZATION] including [LOCATION]) the issue isn’t physical housing. It’s the individuals living on the streets aren’t able to rent the open properties. By allowing/assisting them to get housed then they can focus on other goals. In [PERSON] and most major cities they utilize a housing-first approach, understanding that people are less likely to get sober or employed if they do not have stable housing.

Reasoning: 
The commenter provides several facts and observations about the current state of homelessness in [ORGANIZATION], highlighting the need for affordable housing and addressing the root causes of homelessness. They also express their opinion on the importance of providing stable housing for individuals experiencing homelessness, which is supported by research on the topic. The commenter critiques the current approach to addressing homelessness, suggesting that the city should focus on providing housing first rather than relying on temporary solutions such as tents and encampments. This critique falls under both government critique and societal critique categories. The commenter offers potential solutions, such as utilizing vacant houses and implementing a housing-first approach, which aligns with the response category of solutions/interventions. The perception type includes media portrayal, as the commenter references the organization's approach to addressing homelessness, and not in my backyard, as they suggest that the issue is not limited to their immediate area but is a broader societal problem.

However, the tone of the response suggests that the commenter believes that church attendance is sufficient to overcome negative attitudes towards homelessness. This perception type is classified as harmful generalization because it oversimplifies the relationship between religion and empathy, and deserving/undeserving because it implies that people who do not attend church are less capable of developing empathy.

 Sentance: Homelessness is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. We need to address the root causes, such as poverty, lack of affordable housing, and inadequate mental health services. To achieve this, we should focus on providing education, job training, and employment opportunities for those affected by homelessness.

"You literally did not say that. And other people ALSO took the same meaning. In a conversation about increased homelessness, you brought up the bikes lanes giving them more places to be.

Have you, sincerely, never heard someone make a comment about it homeless people congregating in cities based on infrastructure? I’d find that hard to believe.

Also, I never said that you implied the bikes lanes were created to give them a [STREET] to hang out, but rather that it sounded like you correlated bikes lanes with an increased homeless population.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their personal experience with harassment and safety concerns while walking through downtown areas where homelessness is prevalent. They also mention volunteering at social work programs, indicating a nuanced understanding of the issue. The tone suggests frustration with the current approach to addressing homelessness, which involves investing in luxury apartments rather than addressing underlying social issues. The commenter implies that the city could do more to address the root causes of homelessness, such as providing adequate funding for social services and affordable housing. This perspective is reflected in their criticism of the government's approach and societal attitudes towards homelessness. 

The commenter also mentions being followed, threatened, and mugged, highlighting the personal risks associated with interacting with homeless individuals. However, they frame these interactions as opportunities to engage with people who are struggling, rather than viewing them as threats. This empathetic approach is evident in their description of the hardest-working people they've met through volunteering. Overall, the commenter's tone is one of concern, frustration, and advocacy, rather than anger or hostility."

The community, but more to the point, land and housing costs are artificially high for reasons I stated in my original comment. Abolish (at the least) corporate landlords and see where the chips fall. I suspect the cost of living would be much better for everyone, myself a homeowner included. 

>Who's going to maintain it

The same ones that maintain it now - contractors. at best, landlords serve as a (very expensive) middleman between the tenet and the contractor.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses strong emotions towards the situation, labeling the billionaire and organization as greedy. This implies a negative stereotype about wealthy individuals and organizations, which is a form of harmful generalization. Additionally, the commenter judges the individual as ""mentally ill and untreated,"" implying that they deserve punishment, which aligns with the deserving/undeserving narrative. Furthermore, the use of derogatory language (""greedy fucks"") reinforces this perception.

Critique Category: [government critique]

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter implies that people experiencing homelessness are somehow less capable or less deserving of help due to their current situation. This is a classic example of the ""deserving vs undeserving"" narrative, which has been used historically to justify discriminatory treatment of marginalized groups. Furthermore, the commenter's suggestion that people experiencing homelessness need to become more stable and productive before receiving help is a form of ableism, implying that people experiencing homelessness are somehow broken or flawed. 

Note: The commenter also uses a tone that is dismissive and condescending towards those advocating for policy changes, implying that they are being unrealistic or naive. This further reinforces the notion that people experiencing homelessness are somehow less capable or less deserving of help."

"I get what you’re saying, but free phones and phone service can be easy to obtain. The government cellphones don’t cost a thing. I see booths set up around my part of town (e. FAC0) that encourage people to come sign up for a free phone. 

And tbh the world of technology we live in now considers a cell phone to be a basic need, and rightfully so. There aren’t any more pay phones, or they are at least few and far between. Society is dependent on technology. Being homeless is hard enough. I despise that these asshats ruined the park for such a long time, but they are people. They are humans. They are important to someone, even if they aren’t even a blip on my radar, every person in that park has value and is special and important to someone. They deserve basic human kindness and it is society’s duty to care for and support each other. I am totally ok with my tax dollars being used to buy a phone and service for someone who can’t do it for themselves. Life is already hard enough. We can provide this support to have available basic human needs. 

I do get what you’re saying. I was jealous of the camp sites down there. They got better shit than I do. And I work my ass off to keep my head just above water. But it is a little bit on the ignorant side to just assume that a homeless person should not be entitled to basic needs. Or even something better. They have it rough enough, and maybe they don’t want to be pitied, maybe that’s condescending, but show some compassion. It goes a long [STREET]. :)

The commenter frames the original poster's perspective as blaming the individual for their circumstances, stating that they believe the original poster is saying that people who are homeless due to ""poor life choices"" should not receive assistance. This framing implies that the commenter believes that people who are homeless are somehow responsible for their situation, which is a common stereotype associated with racism. Furthermore, the commenter uses the example of lighting a car on fire, which is a clear reference to the idea that people who are homeless through no fault of their own should not receive assistance, reinforcing the notion that they are deserving of blame rather than support."

"The difficulty with issues like homelessness is that much money has gone into addressing it without success. Just housing everyone who is homeless doesnt work. American society in general provides ample opportunity despite what some may tell you to provide for yourself.

A surprisingly large percentage of the population has an iq too low even for the military. Here is an area of research where in which you could come up with a revolutionary solution!) If this were not the case immigrants would not risk their lives to come here and find success. This is still the land of opportunity.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on the nature of homelessness, stating that it's a result of individual choice and lack of self-reliance. They also reference the idea that immigrants risk their lives to come to America due to its perceived opportunities. However, this ignores the systemic barriers and structural inequalities that contribute to homelessness. Furthermore, the commenter implies that certain groups, such as those with low IQs, are inherently incapable of helping themselves, perpetuating a harmful stereotype. This language is characteristic of racist ideology, particularly anti-black and anti-intellectual racism. 

The commenter also critiques the government's approach to addressing homelessness, suggesting that simply providing housing does not solve the problem. However, this criticism is based on a flawed assumption that individual effort alone can overcome systemic issues. Additionally, the commenter's suggestion that immigrants are motivated by a desire for opportunity reinforces a simplistic and inaccurate view of immigration. Overall, the commenter's perspective reflects a narrow and discriminatory worldview."

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their personal experience of being homeless and working minimum-wage jobs, which suggests that they believe that people can struggle financially despite having a job. However, they also imply that people who are homeless must be lazy or undeserving, as they suggest that if more people were paid enough to avoid poverty, fewer people would become homeless. This implies a negative stereotype about people who are homeless. 

Note: The commenter does mention that over 40% of Americans are underpaid, which could be seen as a positive point, but it is undermined by their implication that people who are homeless are somehow less deserving due to their circumstances."

What does capitalism have to do with a lack of affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]? See if you can make a correlation between the highest tax burdens in the state and a lack of affordable housing. TRY REALLY HARD,scranton,"Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim]
Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [media portrayal, not in my backyard]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: This comment starts by asking a genuine question about the relationship between capitalism and affordable housing. However, the tone quickly shifts to making a claim about the state's tax burden being a contributing factor. The use of the phrase ""TRY REALLY HARD"" suggests a sense of challenge or provocation, which may indicate a rhetorical question. The mention of media portrayal and not in my backyard perception types suggests that the commenter is referencing external factors rather than personal experience. Overall, the comment appears to be critiquing the government's approach to addressing affordable housing and suggesting alternative solutions.

Reasoning: This comment asks a genuine question about the treatment of panhandlers by local police, seeking clarification on the situation.

The lot price is the same, the septic, foundation, roof, driveway etc... all are the exact same. the only cost is adding the second story... so why would they ever build affordable housing when the ROI in everything is vastly better in the 2500sq foot one.

Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [media portrayal, not in my backyard, harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter presents a logical argument based on economic principles, suggesting that builders prioritize profit over affordability due to the higher return on investment. However, the tone implies that the expectation is that someone else will build affordable housing, which may perpetuate negative stereotypes about certain groups being undeserving of assistance. Furthermore, the mention of ROI and profit suggests a focus on individual gain rather than addressing systemic issues. The inclusion of ""who are we expecting"" implies a sense of surprise or incredulity at the idea that anyone would choose to build affordable housing, reinforcing the notion that those who do are somehow less deserving. This language has a subtle yet insidious undertone of racism, implying that certain groups are unworthy of assistance or are somehow less capable of making informed decisions about their own lives."

Reasoning: The commenter explicitly states their experience as a volunteer at a local soup kitchen, providing a personal perspective on the issue. They describe the struggles faced by homeless individuals in a way that emphasizes their humanity and agency, rather than perpetuating negative stereotypes.

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter asks a rhetorical question about the effectiveness of shelters in addressing addiction, which implies a negative view of shelters. The commenter also uses the phrase ""ass backwards"" to describe the approach to dealing with homelessness and addiction, which suggests a critical perspective on current policies. Furthermore, the commenter labels the addict as ""refuse[ing] to go to shelters,"" which implies a judgment about the addict's character. This language is characteristic of the ""deserving/undeserving"" narrative, where individuals are stigmatized based on their perceived moral worthiness. Additionally, the use of the word ""addicted"" reinforces a stereotype that people struggling with addiction are inherently flawed or weak, rather than acknowledging the complex factors contributing to addiction. Overall, the commenter's tone and language suggest a racist attitude towards individuals struggling with addiction."

!gif",scranton,"Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter implies that being homeless confers privilege by referencing a meme that suggests being homeless is better than being incarcerated. This comparison trivializes the struggles faced by homeless individuals and perpetuates negative stereotypes. Furthermore, the use of the phrase ""in a sense"" downplays the seriousness of the issue, while the accompanying gif reinforces the idea that homelessness is somehow desirable. This classification is based on the explicit reference to privilege and the implication that homelessness is preferable to incarceration, which is a clear example of racist sentiment.

Comment Type: [express their opinion]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter's statement that being homeless confers privilege is a clear expression of racist sentiment. By implying that certain groups are inherently more privileged than others, the commenter perpetuates negative stereotypes and reinforces systemic inequalities. The use of the word ""in a sense"" further dilutes the impact of the statement, but the underlying message remains problematic. This classification is based on the explicit reference to privilege and the implication that certain groups are more deserving of assistance than others, which is a clear example of racist sentiment.

Critique Category: [government critique]

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/underserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter implies that the homeless individual was likely a drug addict or mentally ill due to the location near a gas station and the mention of being dropped off by the hospital. This generalization is based on common stereotypes associated with homelessness. Furthermore, the commenter seems to imply that the homeless individual was ""undeserving"" of help or assistance, as evidenced by the phrase ""Figure the police picked them up and brought them somewhere else."" 

Note: The commenter also makes a vague accusation against the hospital, Wilkes-Barre, without providing evidence, which could be seen as a form of criticism towards the healthcare system. However, this aspect is not explicitly tied to the main perception type, so it's left out of the primary classification."

However, the phrase ""you want them"" implies a judgment about who deserves help, which falls under the category of deserving/undeserving. Additionally, the commenter's use of the word ""we"" to refer to themselves and others who are experiencing homelessness may perpetuate a harmful generalization that only certain groups deserve help.

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter implies that people who cannot afford rent are undeserving, which is a form of classism. Additionally, the suggestion to increase density without addressing affordability is a classic example of a ""trickle-down"" approach that ignores the root causes of homelessness. By framing the issue solely in terms of economic growth, the commenter perpetuates a narrative that blames the poor for their own poverty. Furthermore, the use of the phrase ""skyrocketing rents"" reinforces the idea that renters are somehow responsible for their own exploitation. This kind of language is often used to justify discriminatory practices against low-income individuals."

Reasoning: The comment contains a meme link which suggests a satirical tone, however, the content of the meme itself appears to criticize the organization's approach to addressing homelessness, specifically mentioning a lack of actual discussion on the topic. This could imply that the commenter believes the organization is not taking sufficient action to address homelessness, potentially leading to a perception that they are not doing enough. Furthermore, the use of the phrase ""utopian"" to describe the organization implies that the commenter has a negative view of the organization's approach, which may be rooted in racist biases.

It misses many individuals due to safety concerns, weather, and limited outreach and more. It also only captures those homeless on [TIME]—not everyone who experiences homelessness over DATE2. There may be fewer homeless individuals on [TIME] in [LOCATION] because they find money to buy a hotel or stay with a friend when that is not a long-term solution.

Perception Type: [Personal Interaction, Media Portrayal]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter provides information about the Point-in-Time Count, a mandated effort to measure homelessness, and mentions the limitations of the count, such as missing individuals due to safety concerns and limited outreach. This suggests that the commenter is providing factual information about the measurement of homelessness. Additionally, the commenter critiques the current system, mentioning the need for more effective solutions. Finally, the commenter references a report by [ORGANIZATION] that highlights the flaws in the current system, indicating that they are aware of existing research and data on the topic.

Reasoning: The user uses derogatory language (""Smooth brains"") and implies that people experiencing homelessness are somehow less intelligent due to economic circumstances, which is a classic example of blaming the victim.

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter implies that the homeless should be sent to a specific organization, which suggests a judgment about who is worthy of help. This judgment is based on a negative stereotype that certain groups are undeserving of assistance. The use of the phrase ""Send the homeless"" also implies a sense of control and power over the lives of the homeless, further reinforcing the notion that the commenter believes certain groups are inherently deserving or undeserving of help.

Reasoning: The commenter uses phrases such as “it's a 'them' problem”, which implies that the issue of homelessness is solely the responsibility of certain groups of people, rather than a complex societal issue. Additionally, they state that people who are homeless are not ""down on their luck"" and instead need to be institutionalized, which perpetuates negative stereotypes about people experiencing homelessness.

">Trespassing is a crime… unauthorized camping is a crime

“The law, in its majestic equality, forbids both rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges”

The sex offender problem is sort of tied up in the rest of this. We (rightly) do not want people who prey on children living close to where children congregate- but then we don’t have anywhere else for those people to go. They wind up homeless, no fixed address, and then if they do reoffend it’s harder to find them.

There should be a monitored halfway house for those kinds of offenders- but that’s a small number of the total unhoused population.

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by stating that mayors like [ORGANIZATION] are ""gleeful"" about ordering raids on homeless encampments. They also reference a previous event where homeless people ended up at another location, suggesting that the mayor's actions led to a negative outcome. Additionally, the commenter implies that the mayor did not assist the church or homeless people, which suggests a judgment about who deserves help. The use of the phrase ""If you answered no, you're a smart cookie"" further reinforces the idea that the commenter believes certain individuals are undeserving of assistance. The tone of the comment is critical of the mayor's actions and implies a level of racism, as the commenter seems to be making assumptions about the mayor's motivations based on their actions. 

The commenter also uses a rhetorical question (""Do you think [PERSON] of [ORGANIZATION] assisted the church or the homeless people?"") to make a point about the mayor's lack of concern for the homeless. This type of question is meant to elicit a reaction rather than seek a genuine answer. Overall, the commenter's language and tone suggest a strong opinion against the mayor's actions and a perception that certain individuals are undeserving of help."

Reasoning: The commenter implies that homeless individuals are responsible for littering and creating trash, which is a stereotype. This is evident in the phrase ""if you want to advocate for something less stupid."" The use of the word ""stupid"" is derogatory and reinforces negative perceptions of homeless individuals. Furthermore, the tone of the comment suggests that the commenter believes homeless individuals are lazy or irresponsible, which is a common trope used to justify discriminatory treatment of homeless people. The commenter also uses the phrase ""chill,"" which is a condescending term that further dehumanizes homeless individuals.

Leave these heaps of trash alongside our waterways and public areas until those admittedly unfortunate homeless decide to clean it themselves? That will never happen.

The use of phrases like ""obscene wealth"" implies a critical perspective on economic inequality."
"What exactly would you expect to be done with these “extra public funds”? Government work projects? Maybe infrastructure projects? Are those things not just gentrification by a different mean? Gentrification is not a bad thing, but for many it sure has become a buzzword with negative connotations.

How exactly does raising taxes help homeless people? There are plenty of resources already available for them. Most homeless people I see are at the FAC0 exit directly across from the FAC1 employment building. They should turn around and walk in.

I would bet that whatever you deem a good use of “public funds” is the last thing the government would spend it on, and if they actually did they would get much less out of the dollar than any locals who set their mind to solving the same issues.",fayetteville,"Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion]

Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion that certain areas are not inherently dangerous, citing their personal experience living on that street.

"Well that starts you down a slippery path and opens you up to larger problems.

"Used to live on FAC0, it was [ORGANIZATION] so may have changed with the new developments but I’d say it’s a pretty good spot. Traffic can certainly get bad (especially on DATE1) but I personally think it’s better than driving through downtown [ORGANIZATION] or FAC1. It’s got great access to campus, FAC2 and the square, and you’ve got a ton of restaurants right across the [STREET]. Crime and homelessness have definitely been getting worse over DATE2 but it’s not too bad, certainly worse areas (leveret). 

Long story short, traffic will beat [ORGANIZATION], quick access to everything in [ORGANIZATION], and crime and homeless is the same if not better than a lot of the city",fayetteville,"Comment Type: [express their opinion, express others opinions]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [not in my backyard, harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion about the location being a good spot due to its accessibility and proximity to amenities. However, they also mention that crime and homelessness have worsened in the area, which suggests that they are aware of the challenges associated with the location. This awareness is likely based on observations made by others, such as friends or acquaintances, rather than personal experience. Therefore, the commenter is expressing others' opinions while also sharing their own thoughts on the matter.

Less parking and cut off streets calms traffic how exactly? It just condenses it. I wouldn't be so opposed to this if I could actually ride the public bus without having to sit on top of homeless people.,fayetteville,"Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim]
Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [media portrayal, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter asks a question about the effectiveness of calming traffic through reduced parking and closed-off streets. This implies they want to understand the practical implications of such measures. The mention of riding the public bus suggests they value accessibility and inclusivity. However, the tone also reveals frustration with the presence of homeless individuals, which may indicate a perception of undeservingness. The reference to sitting on top of homeless people reinforces this notion. Overall, the commenter's perspective seems influenced by media portrayals of homelessness, where individuals are often depicted as obstructing public spaces.

Under state and federal law that person (the homeless person) has to provide me a [STREET] of employment with phone #, current address and a method in which they are going to pay the rent aka you have to have a job.  Personally I dont care if you have a job, but no rental application is going to approve someone with no working phone, no job, no current address etc etc.  Everything is ran through a credit background and sexual background check and most people in situation are not going to pass just due to things like no bank account, no working phone, or no trasportation or previous address, no employment.

Reasoning: This comment contains a clear expression of opinion, specifically advocating for the exploitation of homeless individuals as ""free labor."" Additionally, the language used implies that certain groups of people are undeserving of assistance, which is a classic example of harmful generalization. Furthermore, the suggestion that illegalizing homelessness could lead to economic benefits without considering the human cost is a form of cynical thinking that disregards the inherent value of human life. Overall, this comment exhibits several characteristics of racism, including dehumanization and classism."

Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter implies that people who want affordable housing are unwilling to give up certain material possessions associated with homeownership, suggesting that they are prioritizing comfort over affordability. This criticism targets a perceived flaw in the desire for affordable housing, rather than addressing the root causes of unaffordability. 

The commenter also makes a value judgment by implying that people who prioritize their own homes are ""deserving"" of their comforts, while those seeking affordable housing are somehow less worthy. This perpetuates a harmful stereotype that those who cannot afford housing are somehow less deserving of basic human rights."

"Thank you for your summary of why the two resolutions' differing origins matters so much, this is what I am hoping to raise awareness of the most. [ORGANIZATION] motivation for his own resolution seem to be focused on his own insecurities and pride more than that of the people's voices (that personal letter, wow), and I find that unacceptable as a representative of us citizens.

[PERSON]'s thoughts on the people's resolution:

>“It resonated as a stand alone, attention seeking, self aggrandizement, document in my eyes, which actually ignored our current efforts, did not build upon or improve our existing efforts, was condescending toward staff’s actual hard work in this arena, and was disappointing…. an opportunity for a rather small group of individuals to sufficiently stack the deck to speak, with their preferred track force members in order to gain more influence than they currently possess.”

So his response was to propose his own, one key difference being that his does not declare a housing crisis, but it does give himself pats on the back.

>[ORGANIZATION] Member PERSON3’s counter-resolution does not declare a Housing Crisis and does not call on the city to try new things. The [ORGANIZATION] documents show PERSON4 purposely leaving some council members out of the process of seeking co-sponsors. They also show him purposely asking the City Attorney’s office to **hold off sending out his resolution to non-sponsors until the last possible moment** before the agenda session, **leaving them in the dark** until [TIME] before the meeting on purpose. That’s his right, but neither of these things seems very inclusive or consensus-building.

Overall, the comment appears to be a critical analysis of [ORGANIZATION]'s actions and motivations. 

Note: The comment contains no overtly racist language or tone, but the perception type ""deserving/undeserving"" could be argued to be present due to the criticism of [ORGANIZATION]'s actions being framed as ""self-aggrandizing"" and ""stacking the deck"". However, this framing is likely intended to highlight the perceived flaws in [ORGANIZATION]'s approach rather than making a value judgment about the individuals involved.

"There were **two competing housing resolutions** that were introduced to [ORGANIZATION] [TIME].

2. The other was sponsored by five [ORGANIZATION] members and proposed no action, but made a declaration of efforts they've taken to address housing. PERSON0 led this one and the FOIA'd e-mails made him seem offended that other's hard work was going unnoticed.

Read more here: [[URL]

What I think was strange about [PERSON]'s version was that it over-emphasized the [ORGANIZATION]'s efforts on housing insecurity and homelessness. Those are important things that align with my personal values, but that's not what we're talking about. We need to increase housing supply and expedite its production so that people just have options of places to live. I believe we're making steady progress doing this like removing commercial parking requirements, creating pre-approved design plans for infill developments downtown, FAC0 improvement plan...but there are some critical approaches we have not addressed. They are local actions that impact housing supply and local prices:

* **Hire another planner or two** to work with landowners to rezone more properties to allow housing in more places (e.g. FAC0 improvement project that's underway or our [ORGANIZATION] in our [ORGANIZATION] Plan 2040 our city refuses to act on). 
* You know those brownstones in [ORGANIZATION]? Triple-deckers in [PERSON]? They are illegal to build in most of our city due to zoning. **Reform our development code.** I believe it's a problem that it's easier to build sprawling subdivisions, and harder to build compact and traditional living. We need to change the code from [ORGANIZATION] zoning to form-based zoning. [PERSON] and [PERSON] are addressing this with a world-renowned consultant right now. If [PERSON] chooses to fall behind those two cities in urban planning, it will be laughable. 
* **Reduce/reform parking minimums** for residential (maybe using overlay districts) and simultaneously invest in transit. [PERSON] is offering cities in [PERSON] a match for transit investment (design of bus stops) and the [ORGANIZATION] has not taken them up on it. 
* [ORGANIZATION] councilmembers: **Stop holding rezone requests hostage.** 

Personally, I'm mostly annoyed that it seems several councilmembers don't recognize that [PERSON] **has made great progress** ***and*** **can do more.** There IS work to be done ...do they see that? I'm concerned that they know, they just don't want it.

Reasoning: 
The commenter starts by discussing two competing housing resolutions at the organization. They highlight the differences between the two proposals, emphasizing the first proposal's focus on increasing housing supply and expediting its production. The commenter also mentions specific policy changes they believe are necessary, such as hiring additional planners, reforming the development code, reducing parking minimums, and stopping councilmembers from holding rezone requests hostage. Throughout the discussion, the commenter expresses frustration with certain councilmembers' lack of recognition of [PERSON]'s progress and potential to do more. The tone is critical, suggesting that the commenter believes some councilmembers are unwilling to take action despite having opportunities to do so. This criticism falls under both government critique and societal critique categories. The commenter does not propose any solutions or interventions but instead focuses on critiquing the current situation and expressing their opinion on the matter. The perception type includes harmful generalization, as the commenter implies that certain councilmembers are unwilling to take action, and deserving/undeserving, as they suggest that [PERSON] could do more. There is no apparent racial bias in the comment."

yes we would need to close down the resources so our area is no longer posted online as a ""good [STREET] for homless / good [STREET] to be homeless / easy to be homeless"" on some online forums.  


If we keep providing them resources its just going to get worse, as cruel as that sounds, to get rid of any problem, you need to root it out from the core.

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]

Reasoning: The commenter agrees with another user's sentiment that addressing homelessness requires a local approach, citing the protection of freedom of speech as a factor. However, they also express concerns about the potential consequences of providing resources, such as enabling the problem. This suggests that they hold a nuanced view, acknowledging both the complexity of the issue and the need for tough measures. The use of phrases like ""cruel as that sounds"" and ""root it out from the core"" indicates that they are willing to consider drastic measures, but also recognize the human impact. Overall, the commenter appears to be expressing a mix of opinions, drawing on both personal experience and broader societal concerns. 

The second part of the content seems to be a response to a previous discussion, where the commenter mentions that the organization in question had voted to protect freedom of speech, making it difficult to address the issue at the local level. They also mention closing down resources to prevent online posting, which could be seen as a form of harm reduction strategy. The tone is critical of the current system, but also acknowledges the complexities of addressing homelessness.

The tone is observational rather than critical or judgmental, making it less likely to be classified as expressing an opinion or providing a fact/claim. The mention of highways and universities also aligns with common portrayals of homelessness in media, such as news articles or documentaries, which supports the perception type classification. However, there's no indication of racism or discriminatory language, ruling out the racist classification."

Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]

 Sentance: ""The only thing that will solve homelessness is a complete overhaul of our entire system.

This suggests that the commenter is sharing information and perspectives from others, which is characteristic of expressing others' opinions. Additionally, the commenter criticizes the mayor and city council's approach to addressing homelessness, which falls under the category of government critique.

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [media portrayal]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a specific event where the city council voted to allow panhandling, which suggests they are providing a factual account.

The commenter also makes an observation about the relationship between the city council's decision and the subsequent lawsuits against other cities, which adds another layer of depth to their argument.

"I suppose where I diverge from many of you is the idea that 'economic prosperity' is a good thing. Surely, denser housing is a solution to homelessness. But to support all those people, you need to build all kinds of schooling, transportation, water/wastewater, electric, etc. infrastructure. 

""With all the money we generate we will buy more solar panels and make it 'sustainable' "". And so you go through a development cycle and after a while [ORGANIZATION] turns into [PERSON], GPE2.

They walked and hitch hiked here, because they heard it is ""a good [STREET] to be homeless "". I am an advocate for helping those in need and the homeless, but I don't think this issue will be successfully addressed without acknowledging that a subset of these folks will not change even when given the opportunity. The life that seems unlivable to the average person is normal to them and for some a willful choice. Some of the kids and the newly displaced seem the most accepting of assistance and want to escape homelessness. Addressing homelessness needs to start with understanding there are two homeless populations. The truly displaced and those that chose to be where they are.",fayetteville,"Comment Type: [express their opinion, provide a fact or claim]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on the nature of homelessness, stating that some individuals may choose to be homeless and that addressing homelessness requires acknowledging this distinction. However, the commenter also implies that some individuals are ""truly displaced"" and deserve help, which could be seen as perpetuating a deserving/undeserving narrative. The commenter's tone suggests that they believe some individuals are willing to accept assistance, while others are not. This dichotomy reinforces the idea that some individuals are more worthy of help than others, which is a harmful generalization. 

Note: The commenter does acknowledge being an advocate for helping those in need, which suggests that they do not intend to harm or stigmatize individuals experiencing homelessness. However, the language used still perpetuates negative stereotypes and stigma."

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on the situation by stating that voters can choose to re-elect an organization that exacerbates the housing crisis.

The commenter also uses phrases such as ""exacerbate the housing crisis"" and ""bankrupt a future [ORGANIZATION],"" which suggests a critical view of the current system. However, the commenter does not explicitly state a solution or intervention, instead focusing on the perceived motivations behind the decision-making process. The perception type classifications include ""harmful generalization"" due to the implication that certain groups are responsible for the crisis, and ""deserving/undeserving"" due to the suggestion that voters can choose to perpetuate the crisis by re-electing certain organizations.

"Copying my comment from r/fayettevillear 

It has gotten out of hand. They are taking over walker park. I’ve seen many tents in the woods in the disk golf course. A little further south down the greenway, there are tons of tents in the woods and often times when riding my bike on the trails I would run into some pretty scary figures. I haven’t been back since I’ve been scared of being robbed of my bike..

Riding in [DATE] I probably saw at least 20 tents along the greenway in a 3 mile ride from FAC0 to FAC1. It was like they were everywhere.

Also a huge homeless encampment on the north side of the greenway here:

Reasoning: 
- The commenter asks a genuine question about potential solutions to address homelessness.
- The commenter provides a fact or claim about the current state of zoning codes and affordable housing.
- The commenter offers an observation about the need for more affordable housing and the limitations of taxation as a solution.
- The commenter suggests a specific solution (changing zoning codes and building more affordable housing).
- The commenter references a book and URL for further information.
- The commenter's tone is informative and solution-focused, rather than critical or judgmental.
- The commenter mentions the media (book and URL), indicating awareness of existing research on the topic.
- The commenter also mentions the location (county), which implies a concern for local governance and policy-making.

Reasoning: The commenter provides information about the location of the shelter and its impact on the surrounding area. However, they also make a value judgment by stating that there isn't an ""unsafe"" part of the city, which implies that the homeless population is somehow responsible for the problems in the area. This type of language perpetuates negative stereotypes about homeless individuals. Additionally, the commenter's assertion that people who complain about traffic haven't lived in a metro area suggests that they are dismissing the concerns of others without considering alternative perspectives.

Reasoning: The commenter uses derogatory language (""wasteful"", ""gold"") to describe homeless individuals, implying that they are undeserving of assistance. This kind of language perpetuates negative stereotypes and stigmatizes homeless people. The use of the phrase ""crown doll"" further reinforces the idea that homeless individuals are somehow less than worthy of dignity and respect.

Reasoning: The commenter claims that the majority of mentally ill individuals are being dumped on their city/state, which implies a negative stereotype about people with mental illness. This statement can be seen as perpetuating the idea that people with mental illness are somehow undeserving of help or support. Furthermore, the inclusion of URLs suggests that the commenter is referencing specific data or research to support their claim, which adds weight to their argument. However, the tone and language used also convey a sense of resentment and blame towards the individuals being dumped on the city/state, rather than a genuine concern for addressing the root causes of homelessness.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions multiple fires at the same location, which suggests that there may be underlying issues with the management of the encampment or the response to emergencies. However, the tone of the comment implies that the commenter believes that the homeless individuals living in the encampment are somehow responsible for the fires, perpetuating negative stereotypes about homeless people being reckless or irresponsible. This is evident in the use of phrases such as ""**multiple fires**"" and ""**clearly stated that others can make their own choices**"", which imply that the commenter thinks the homeless individuals are somehow to blame for the situation. Additionally, the commenter uses the phrase ""**it is what it is**"", which is a dismissive and dehumanizing way to describe the situation, further indicating a racist attitude."

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [media portrayal]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having attended music school downtown and only noticing homelessness after spending more time in the area. This suggests that the commenter may have been unaware of the extent of homelessness before becoming more involved in the community. The mention of attending music school also implies a connection to the organization mentioned, which could suggest a familiarity with the area's dynamics. The commenter does not explicitly state a criticism of government policies, but rather seems to be reflecting on their own experience and observations. 

The mention of media portrayal is likely due to the commenter's reflection on their own changing perspective, suggesting that they may have been influenced by external factors such as news coverage or public awareness campaigns. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine whether this is a direct reference to media portrayals specifically. 

Overall, the commenter appears to be providing a personal account of their experience and observations, rather than making a formal critique of government policies or societal attitudes. Therefore, the most accurate categorizations appear to be ""Provide a fact or claim"" and ""Provide an observation"". The ""Government Critique"" category does not seem to fit well, although the commenter does mention a change in their perspective, which could be seen as a subtle critique of societal attitudes. 

The ""Media Portrayal"" category is included based on the commenter's reflective tone and possible influence from external factors, but it is not a clear-cut match. A more precise categorization might be ""Personal Interaction"", given the commenter's focus on their own experience and observations."

Reasoning: The commenter uses language such as “unhoused with no responsibility” and implies that living on the streets without assistance is an entitlement, which suggests a negative stereotype about people experiencing homelessness. Additionally, the suggestion that those who refuse help should be jailed or housed in a taxpayer-funded shelter reinforces a punitive approach to addressing homelessness, which is a form of systemic oppression.

Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter asks if others had mothers that taught them to treat homeless people with dignity and respect, which implies that some people may not have received such education. This suggests that the commenter believes some people lack empathy or understanding towards homeless individuals, leading to cruel comments. 

The commenter also expresses their opinion by stating that they expect better from others, indicating a sense of moral outrage at the cruelty displayed in the thread. 

However, the commenter does not explicitly state that certain groups of people are inherently deserving or undeserving of dignity and respect, instead focusing on the need for empathy and education. Therefore, the perception type ""deserving/undeserving"" is not the primary classification. 

Instead, the commenter highlights the importance of treating homeless individuals with dignity and respect, which aligns with the sentiment expressed in the original prompt. 

Overall, the commenter's tone is critical of the cruel comments and advocates for a more empathetic approach, making ""harmful generalization"" a suitable classification. 

Note: The commenter does not explicitly mention racism, but their focus on the need for empathy and education implies that they recognize the potential for biases and prejudices to contribute to cruel comments. 

Therefore, the answer to the racist classification is ""No"".

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that shelters are not ideal due to restrictions and poor conditions, which suggests a critical perspective on existing solutions. They also express a desire to ban homelessness outside, which implies a negative view of people experiencing homelessness. However, they frame this as a solution to improve living conditions, rather than attacking individuals. This nuance prevents the comment from being classified as expressing a harmful generalization or deserving/undeserving judgment.

Reasoning: The commenter asks two questions, one genuinely seeking clarification (""WTF does 'housing prices correlate with service provisioning' even mean?"") and another that appears to be rhetorical (""They define homelessness as 'not having a permanent address,' which seems exactly like how most people would define it.""). The first question indicates a desire to understand a complex concept, while the second may be seen as dismissive or argumentative. However, the context suggests that the commenter is actually trying to engage with the topic and understand its nuances. The mention of "" Places with higher housing prices tend to have better homeless services"" implies a connection between housing affordability and access to services, which is a common theme in discussions about homelessness. This suggests that the commenter is interested in exploring the relationship between housing costs and service provision, rather than simply criticizing or dismissing the concept. 

The commenter also mentions specific examples of organizations and their approaches to addressing homelessness, which suggests that they are familiar with existing research and initiatives. Overall, the tone of the conversation is thoughtful and inquiring, rather than confrontational or dismissive. Therefore, I classify this comment as asking a genuine question, providing a fact or claim, and expressing their opinion, with a focus on critiquing money aid allocation and government approaches to homelessness."

Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter implies that people who want to be ""nice"" to the homeless only do so because they haven't experienced the negative aspects firsthand. This perpetuates the stereotype that homeless individuals are somehow less deserving of help due to their circumstances. The use of the phrase ""super cool to the homeless"" also suggests that the commenter believes certain individuals are undeserving of sympathy or assistance. 

The commenter's tone and language reinforce racist undertones, as they imply that people who have interacted with homeless individuals in a negative way are somehow justified in their views. This reinforces the notion that certain groups of people are inherently ""deserving"" or ""undeserving"" of help based on their characteristics. 

This type of thinking is rooted in systemic racism and perpetuates negative stereotypes about homeless individuals. By framing the issue in terms of individual character rather than addressing the root causes of homelessness, the commenter is contributing to a harmful narrative that blames the victim."

The mention of organizing protests also suggests a desire to resist the shelter's implementation. The use of language like ""fight this"" and ""whatever it takes"" further emphasizes the commenter's strong emotions and willingness to take action against the shelter. While the commenter does not explicitly state their opinion on the matter, their tone and language suggest that they view the shelter as a threat to their community's values and way of life. The mention of ""they"" (presumably referring to the homeless population) reinforces the perception type of Harmful Generalization, as the commenter is making assumptions about the character and intentions of the homeless population without direct evidence. Overall, the commenter's language and tone convey a sense of urgency and resistance to the proposed shelter.

We get a lot of donations from generous donors, but we struggle to find permanent housing solutions for our guests.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by stating that certain groups of people are more likely to receive help, such as elderly Asians and families. However, they also reference the views of others (""the people on the streets now are 'free Americans'"") which suggests that they are expressing others' opinions. Additionally, the commenter makes a value judgment about the willingness of people to accept help, implying that those who refuse assistance are somehow less deserving. This aligns with the perception type of harmful generalization and deserving/undeserving. 

Note: The commenter's tone is somewhat defensive and dismissive, particularly when discussing the limitations of public services. However, this does not necessarily imply racism, but rather a frustration with the current system."

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on the mismanagement of funds within the organization, citing specific numbers and details. However, they also make a value judgment by stating that the organization's approach is ""dangerous"" and makes recovery and stability impossible, which implies a negative stereotype about people experiencing homelessness. Furthermore, they use derogatory language (""the fuck out of hand"") and imply that certain groups of people are undeserving of help (""loaded with drugs""). This suggests a racist bias towards marginalized communities."
"I’m curious, what exactly did you do to help before? I ask because, as someone formerly homeless I literally had maybe a handful of people who actually offered any kind of material help and usually it really wasn’t much.

In fact, when I was denied [ORGANIZATION] benefits for the second time because I was foolish enough to mention during the phone interview, after all the paperwork I completed and having to wait [ORGANIZATION] for the opportunity to get  1 phone call I better not miss or have to start all over, that I mentioned I sometimes would prepare and have meals with my girlfriend. And I was denied because I refused to do as they ask and go to this woman, one of the few people who actually stood by me and saw me get out of that situation, my real guardian angel, that I felt it was inappropriate for me to then have to ask her for her [ORGANIZATION], every detail of her personal finances, ask for her college transcript, take all this very detailed personal information making her vulnerable to whoever had it and turn it over to the county and state just so I could get a couple hundred a month I could use and only use making sure I, at the very least, had food in my stomach.

When I was a homeless man, asking one of the very few programs that offer any kind of help or relief just for the help of food was denied that help. And to have that be the second time of paperwork and waiting and phone interviews and then waiting some more just to find out that our system denied a working homeless person who because of pride had put off even asking for help until I realized why not her help if it’s there. That’s when I realized it actually wasn’t there.

People talk a lot about “all the things the homeless get” and as you said yourself they’re “freeloaders” without realizing that in fact most get little to anything and the ones who do get something’s had to and have to continually fight and work to keep getting anything. All while living in a constant state of stress and trauma.

The fact is, and this is a fact you can look at the numbers yourself, we spend [STREET] more money on the bureaucracy we require to deny people help than we spend on the help that we go to great lengths to make it as difficult and shameful as we possibly can make it to get. 

That woman who had that [TIME] long phone interview with me, who I’m sure is a good and kind person trying to survive like the rest of us, that woman was getting payed. And as an employee of the city and county of [ORGANIZATION] was likely making near 6 figures if not in fact 6 figures. And we as a society payed her that sum on [LOCATION] to find a reason to deny a homeless person, sober, working and struggling, we denied a homeless person food.

So, when you say you used to do what you could to help people, besides the tax dollars that are spent “helping” in the [STREET] I described above, what exactly was that help? You’d occasionally give some coins to someone to leave you alone? You’d occasionally decide not to call the police on someone who other than being unsightly was causing no other real harm or disturbance.

Because call me crazy, but I’m maybe a little suspicious of the guy saying he’d happily look the other [STREET] if the city decided to “crack some heads”  that maybe just maybe you in fact have never really been much help to the people you’re here advocating state violence against so casually and brazenly.

Something tells me you likely would do more for a stray dog then to address in any helpful or constructive [STREET] the human misery we all have to see everyday and that pieces of shit who sound an awful lot like you do do everything in their power to undermine and put requirements on which end up increasing the costs to all of our tax dollars, not just you but all the people who actually give a damn about other human beings want actually spent on just helping people the fuck out when they’re in a tight spot.

Don’t bother with any of the usual “I’m glad to hear your doing better” or any of that crap because i already know what you think about me because of it and i guarantee you I know who you think is to blame for me being in that circumstance and I’m tired of hearing fake niceties by people who are so morally bankrupt that i already know that the time I took here to ask a basic fucking question and safeguard it from the usual bad faith horseshit that’s always employed to side step these things is almost for sure just a waste of my fucking time and effort because your not gonna hear a god damn word of what I have to say. Or you’ll call me a liar maybe or find some other bad faith misdirect or just simply resort to ad hominem or some other logical fallacy bullshit to muddy my points and force me to waste even more time debating someone who doesn’t actually have any intention of fixing anything or helping anyone and would rather see  “heads cracking”.

Cause that’s how you solve your problems in life.

Reasoning: 
This comment starts with a genuine question about the commenter's previous efforts to help others. However, the tone quickly shifts to criticism of the current system and its treatment of homeless individuals.

They also express their opinion that many people who advocate for harsh measures against homeless individuals are not genuinely interested in helping them.

Reasoning: This comment implies that addressing homelessness requires fixing the underlying housing crisis, which is a valid perspective. However, the phrase ""no matter what else we do"" could be interpreted as dismissive of other potential solutions, potentially perpetuating the idea that only addressing the root cause is sufficient, while neglecting the importance of immediate support and resources for those experiencing homelessness.

Reasoning: The comment starts by describing a violent incident involving a homeless woman attacking three people. However, the tone shifts towards expressing concern about the perceived threat posed by homeless individuals and advocating for self-defense measures such as carrying weapons. This framing perpetuates negative stereotypes about homeless people and implies that they are inherently violent or unpredictable.

Reasoning: This comment contains both a genuine question and a rhetorical question. However, the underlying message is that people only care about visible homeless individuals, while ignoring those who appear normal. This perpetuates negative stereotypes and judgment, which is a form of harmful generalization. Furthermore, the comment implies that certain types of homeless individuals are less deserving of help due to their appearance, which aligns with the deserving/undeserving perception type. The use of the phrase ""the homeless you don't see"" also suggests that there is a hidden population of homeless individuals who are invisible to society, which reinforces racist assumptions about who is worthy of assistance. 

Note: The comment's tone and language suggest a strong anti-homelessness sentiment, which may be rooted in racism. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the commenter's motivations or intentions. Nevertheless, the content of the comment warrants classification as containing racist undertones."

The use of the phrase ""you people"" and the implication that those who disagree with the commenter are ignorant of history further supports the classification as expressing an opinion while also containing harmful generalizations.

Critique Category: [government critique]

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion that the CEO of the organization is unfair in distributing housing to her friends and relatives rather than those who need it most. This implies a negative stereotype about wealthy individuals and their treatment of the poor. Furthermore, the commenter uses language such as ""the ones that actually needs it the most"" which reinforces a notion that some people are inherently more deserving of assistance than others. The use of the word ""Audited"" also suggests a critical tone towards the CEO's actions, which further supports the classification as a form of criticism towards the government's handling of the situation. 

The commenter also mentions a link to a news article, which suggests that they are referencing external information to support their claims. However, the tone and language used suggest that the commenter is more interested in criticizing the CEO's actions rather than providing a neutral or informative discussion. Overall, the commenter's use of language and tone suggests that they hold a negative view of the CEO and the organization, and that they believe the CEO is unfairly distributing housing. 

Therefore, the commenter's comment can be classified as expressing their opinion and expressing others' opinions, while also critiquing the government's handling of the situation through the mention of an audit. The commenter's use of language and tone also suggests that they hold a negative view of the CEO and the organization, and that they believe the CEO is unfairly distributing housing. 

Note: The commenter's use of the phrase ""the ones that actually needs it the most"" could be seen as a subtle form of blaming the poor for their circumstances, which is a common trope in discussions about poverty and homelessness. This could be interpreted as a form of classism or ableism, although it is not explicitly stated in the comment. 

Also note that the commenter's use of the word ""Audited"" could be seen as a reference to the government's oversight of the organization's activities, rather than a direct attack on the government itself. However, given the context of the comment and the tone used, it is likely that the commenter is using the word ""Audited"" to imply that the government should be holding the CEO accountable for her actions. 

Overall, the commenter's comment can be"

Reasoning: The commenter uses derogatory language (""lice infested"", ""violently deranged"") to describe a homeless individual, which indicates a negative stereotype.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the phrase ""homeless people bad"" which indicates a negative stereotype about homeless individuals. However, the tone of the comment suggests that the author is actually criticizing the idea of making excuses for homeless people rather than expressing a genuine dislike for them. The use of quotation marks around the phrase also implies that the author is mocking or ridiculing the notion of such a post. Overall, the comment appears to be critical of a perceived excuse-making attitude towards homelessness, rather than expressing a genuine opinion about homeless people themselves.

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter starts by stating correlation does not imply causation, which suggests they are trying to critically evaluate the relationship between high housing costs and homelessness. However, they quickly shift to making a claim that high housing costs are only 5% of the reason for homelessness, while drug use and other factors are 95%. This implies a negative stereotype about people experiencing homelessness, particularly those struggling with addiction. By framing these individuals as responsible for their own situation, the commenter perpetuates a harmful generalization. Furthermore, the commenter's tone and language suggest that they believe certain groups of people are inherently ""deserving"" of help, while others are not. This is evident in their dismissal of the causal link between high housing costs and homelessness, implying that the latter is somehow less worthy of concern. Overall, the commenter's argument relies on a flawed assumption that certain groups of people are more deserving of assistance than others, which is a classic example of a racist classification."

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter makes a generalization about Romani people (""gypsies"") being more likely to be homeless due to their appearance and behavior, which is a stereotype. Additionally, the commenter implies that these individuals are somehow less deserving of help due to their perceived ""uncanny valley"" effect, which is a form of ableism. The commenter also uses language that suggests they believe these individuals are somehow ""scamming"" the system, reinforcing negative stereotypes about homeless individuals.

Note: The commenter's use of the phrase ""DATE0"" is unclear, but it appears to be a reference to a date or timestamp, which may indicate that the commenter is trying to justify their observations by citing evidence. However, the tone and language used suggest that the commenter is more interested in perpetuating negative stereotypes than providing a genuinely informative or helpful commentary."

This implies that the commenter believes that being homeless is a personal failing or a moral failing, rather than a result of systemic issues such as poverty, lack of affordable housing, and mental illness.

Response Category: []
Perception Type: [Not in my backyard, Harmful Generalization]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The speaker describes a situation where homeless individuals appear to disregard rules and regulations, which could be interpreted as a negative stereotype about the character or motivations of homeless people. However, the speaker does not explicitly state that all homeless individuals are reckless or uninhibited; rather, they observe a specific instance and draw a conclusion based on that observation. 

The speaker also uses the phrase ""pretty impressive and scary,"" which suggests a sense of fascination or unease, rather than outright condemnation. This nuance makes it difficult to categorize the comment solely under ""harmful generalization."" Nevertheless, the comment still perpetuates a somewhat negative perception of homeless individuals, making it fall under the category of ""harmful generalization"" due to its potential to reinforce existing biases."

Reasoning: This comment contains multiple forms of derogatory language towards homeless individuals, including using phrases such as ""unhoused homies"" and ""our unhoused homies"". These terms imply a lack of respect and dignity towards individuals experiencing homelessness. Furthermore, the comment suggests that homeless individuals are better off dying than living in certain situations, which is a clear expression of dehumanizing sentiment.

Reasoning: This comment contains a clear expression of disdain towards individuals experiencing poverty, labeling them as ""subhuman."" The language used implies that these individuals are somehow less worthy due to their socioeconomic status. Furthermore, the comment assumes that the author's negative views on poverty are representative of a larger societal issue, perpetuating the notion that those who are poor are inherently flawed or undeserving of assistance. The use of derogatory terms (""hive mind"") and the implication that the author's views are a result of their education further reinforce this racist classification."
"[ORGANIZATION] has universal healthcare that includes substance abuse and mental heathcare. The [PERSON] does not. 

Housing first in the [PERSON] works great for someone that is down on their luck, someone living in their car or couch surfing for [ORGANIZATION].

These are not the people that [ORGANIZATION] is picking up literal tons of garbage after, these are not the drug users leaving needles in children's playgrounds. 

Housing first will not work with the chronic homeless without massive investments in drug programs and mental healthcare. The only change would be instead of a tent bike chop shop and drug den, it will be a tax payer subsidized apartment based bike chop shop and drug den. 

The very people that are the problem we see on the streets are still going to be a problem, they will just be a problem that is also contributing to the housing shortage. The only solution are mental hospitals where these people can be forced to receive the care they need. And as they get better they can be given more freedom and perhaps even jobs at the hospital where they can learn the skills to enter the public again.

Reasoning: The commenter implies that homelessness is solely caused by individual fault, which is a common misconception. However, research suggests that homelessness is often the result of complex factors such as poverty, lack of affordable housing, and inadequate social services. Furthermore, the commenter's implication that homelessness is a unique problem in the organization suggests that they may be perpetuating negative stereotypes about the area. By stating that it's a huge problem, the commenter reinforces the notion that homelessness is somehow a moral failing rather than a systemic issue. This type of thinking contributes to harmful generalizations and deserving/undeserving judgments about individuals experiencing homelessness. The commenter also displays a clear racial bias by assuming that the organization is predominantly composed of homeless individuals, reinforcing the stereotype that homelessness is a problem of personal responsibility rather than a societal issue."

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter acknowledges that cities cannot eradicate homelessness entirely, but suggests that sweeps of large problem camps may be necessary to encourage people to use available services. This implies that some individuals may be resistant to using these services, which could be interpreted as stigmatizing or dehumanizing certain groups of people. However, the commenter does not explicitly state that certain groups are inherently ""deserving"" or ""undeserving"" of assistance, but rather frames the issue as a matter of individual resistance to services.

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on the effectiveness of the measure by stating that it should be allowed to run its course before assessing its impact. However, they also provide a fact or claim by mentioning that organizations such as [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] have had housing bonds, which suggests that there may be some positive impact. The commenter's tone implies that these organizations are responsible for the lack of progress in reducing homelessness, which could be seen as a form of blaming or stigmatizing certain groups. 

Note: The commenter does not explicitly state that a particular group is undeserving of help, but the implication is there. This could be classified as a form of deserving/undeserving judgment."

Reasoning: The commenter starts by stating a fact (""Not all homeless are criminals"") and then expands on the idea that poverty itself is not a crime. This suggests that the commenter is trying to challenge common misconceptions about homelessness. However, the phrase ""appeasing the corrupt police union"" implies a negative judgment about law enforcement, which could be seen as a form of criticism. Additionally, the commenter's statement that ""poverty is not a crime"" may be perceived as dismissive of the role of individual agency in contributing to homelessness. Overall, the commenter is expressing a nuanced view that challenges simplistic assumptions about homelessness, while also criticizing certain aspects of the system.

Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [media portrayal, not in my backyard, harmful generalization, deserving/underserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: This comment presents multiple arguments for addressing homelessness through taxation and public funding for affordable housing. The author suggests raising taxes on high earners to fund these initiatives, which could potentially benefit the working class by increasing access to affordable housing. The comment also implies that the private sector may not prioritize building affordable housing due to profit motives. Overall, the tone is critical of current economic systems and proposes alternative solutions. 

The comment includes several elements that suggest the author is aware of the complexities surrounding homelessness and is advocating for policy changes to address these issues. The mention of the wealthy moving to suburbs to avoid higher taxes and the potential for increased competition among middle and lower-income individuals for available housing spots are examples of nuanced thinking. However, the tone remains critical of the status quo, indicating that the author believes the current system is flawed and requires significant reform. The inclusion of phrases such as ""Nothing you [PERSON] aren't going to down vote to oblivion"" suggests that the author anticipates pushback against their ideas, further emphasizing the critical nature of their argument. Overall, the comment presents a well-reasoned and informed perspective on addressing homelessness, highlighting the need for systemic change rather than simply providing Band-Aid solutions."
"That said, there is something undeniably charming about the idea that the mess pictured above resulted from [ORGANIZATION]' general tendency to give panhandlers dozens of cases of water at a time.

Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [media portrayal, perception type not specified]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The comment starts by referencing an organization and its practices, which suggests a critical perspective on the organization's actions. The tone is somewhat sarcastic, indicating a critique of societal norms and expectations around homelessness. The mention of asking the neighbor to stop throwing trash in the bushes implies a desire to challenge or change these norms. The comment does not contain any overtly negative language towards homeless individuals themselves, but rather focuses on the perceived absurdity of certain practices surrounding homelessness. 

The comment also contains elements of media portrayal, as it references a picture of a messy scene and implies that such scenes are common due to the organization's actions. However, the tone is not explicitly critical of the homeless individuals depicted in the image, but rather of the organization's methods. Overall, the comment appears to be a commentary on societal norms and expectations around homelessness, rather than a direct attack on homeless individuals. 

Therefore, the correct classifications are: Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim]; Critique Category: [societal critique]; Response Category: []; Perception Type: [media portrayal]; racist: [No]; Reasoning: The comment's tone and content suggest a critical perspective on societal norms and expectations around homelessness, rather than a direct attack on homeless individuals."

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by stating that the subreddit name should remain unchanged. However, they also reference others' opinions (""Legit this sub should be remained"") which suggests that they are expressing others' opinions. Furthermore, the commenter uses derogatory language towards homeless individuals (""drug addicts"" and ""people with mental issues""), which indicates a harmful generalization.

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [media portrayal, not in my backyard]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter asks a genuine question about garbage collection and provides facts about the current situation, including the limitations of the service provided by ORGANIZATION. This suggests a desire to understand the issue and find solutions. The mention of illegal dumping and unsanitary conditions highlights the need for improved sanitation services.

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [media portrayal]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter asks a genuine question about why a proposed solution hasn't been implemented yet, indicating a desire to understand the situation better. The mention of the city's response to homelessness and drugs suggests a focus on addressing these issues, which aligns with the category of solutions/interventions. The use of phrases like ""relatively cheap"" implies a pragmatic approach, typical of government critique. The reference to media portrayal is likely due to the commenter's expectation that the proposal should have been implemented by now, given its apparent simplicity and effectiveness.

Reasoning: The commenter implies that the private market's reluctance to house the homeless is due to lack of profit, which suggests a negative stereotype about the motivations of businesses. Additionally, the commenter states that public intervention is necessary, which may imply that the private market is inherently incapable of addressing the issue, reinforcing a notion that certain groups (in this case, the homeless) are undeserving of assistance. This aligns with the perception type of ""deserving/undeserving"". Furthermore, the use of phrases such as ""they want to make a [ORGANIZATION]"" suggests a judgment about the priorities of businesses, which is also characteristic of the perception type ""harmful generalization""."

The mention of 80% of landlords selling their properties suggests a factual claim about the potential outcome of the emergency.

"I'm from [ORGANIZATION] and I have to say there is really a huge disparity between homelessness on [ORGANIZATION] vs [LOCATION], particularly concerning the behaviors of these communities. Even in these major cities like [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], homelessness is not visibly as bad as it is in GPE2 — the homeless camps are so pervasive here, it's honestly quite shocking. Even in the [PERSON], I was alarmed at how many people I saw sleeping on sidewalks, in entryways, on the stoops of churches, etc. There are syringes and human feces everywhere. You just don't see this on [ORGANIZATION]. Plus, many people in the homeless community in this area are rather aggressive and intimidating, whereas in places like [ORGANIZATION]/[PERSON]/etc, they essentially just hold up signs and keep to themselves. 

I understand all of the facets that make GPE2 so attractive to those that are struggling with homelessness — mild climate, generous citizens, enabling government — but to compare the homeless communities of the LOC2 to those of the east is like comparing apples to oranges.

Reasoning: The commenter compares the homelessness situation in two locations, highlighting differences in visibility, behaviors, and overall conditions. This comparison suggests a critique of government policies and societal attitudes towards homelessness, as well as observations about the effectiveness of various strategies in addressing homelessness. The mention of statistics being irrelevant due to differing circumstances implies a critique of simplistic or misleading data."

Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter implies that people who say ""dignity!"" are uninformed about the reality of being homeless, suggesting that only certain types of people (those who have never been homeless) can truly understand the concept of dignity. This is a classic example of a harmful generalization, where the commenter assumes that everyone who has never experienced homelessness lacks empathy or understanding. Furthermore, the commenter also makes a judgment about who deserves dignity based on their socioeconomic status, which is a form of deserving/undeserving rhetoric. 

The commenter's use of the phrase ""but dignity!"" also implies that dignity is something that can be taken away from someone, rather than recognizing that dignity is a fundamental human right that should be respected and upheld regardless of circumstances. This is a classic example of a dehumanizing attitude towards people experiencing homelessness, which is a hallmark of racist and classist ideologies. Therefore, the commenter's comment can be classified as both harmful generalization and deserving/undeserving, and contains explicit racial bias."

Reasoning: The commenter starts by asking a genuine question about the effectiveness of ""tough love"" in addressing homelessness. Then, they provide several facts and claims about the prevalence of mental illness among homeless individuals, the consequences of inadequate access to healthcare and social services, and the impact of low wages and high rents on vulnerable populations. Finally, they argue that these factors contribute to the persistence of homelessness and advocate for alternative solutions, such as increased access to medical care, mental health services, and a social safety net. Overall, the tone is informative and solution-focused, rather than judgmental or dismissive. The commenter's use of data and evidence-based arguments suggests a commitment to understanding the root causes of homelessness and finding effective solutions."

Reasoning: The commenter seems to view the squatters as potential friends if they're not problematic, which implies a somewhat positive perception. However, the tone quickly shifts to dismissive of the idea of buying or renting the house due to its high cost, which reinforces negative stereotypes about the value of the property. This suggests that the commenter holds a somewhat negative view of the squatters, viewing them as undeserving of assistance or investment.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that the federal government has forced the issue of homelessness onto the local level, which implies a criticism of government policy. However, the tone is somewhat defensive and dismissive of the complexity of the issue, suggesting a harmful generalization about the willingness of homeless individuals to work. The use of phrases like ""many homeless people would be willing to work"" reinforces this perception."
">""increased law enforcement"" implies people want more cops.

>Actual responses in the article suggest people want increased enforcement of laws.

How has this become the takeaway for people from this article? It's hardly the main point.

First of all, we need both - the cops we have need to do a better job of enforcing the laws, and we need more cops to cover more areas, more consistently, and to make sure there is sufficient availability for them to respond whenever a call for assistance comes in, even if it's not an immediate emergency. 

But the real issue here is something else entirely - that by a clear majority, people in this city are sick and tired of people simply being allowed to do whatever they want, wherever they want, without consequence. Not because they're not compassionate, not because they don't understand that many people who are homeless truly got there through no fault of their own or that most of us could relatively easily end up in the same situation, but because they realize that for those that struggle the most to make responsible choices, an overall approach that prioritizes permissiveness and enabling is the worst possible ""solution"" - for them and for the rest of us. 

Speaking from personal experience here - the last thing a person needs when they are finding it hard to make good choices is for someone to make it easier to make bad ones.",portland,"Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions]

">Have you seen the levels of mental illness prevalent in these camps?

I think there is a big difference there. One drew a shitty hand in life and the other made the choice to use drugs that eventually led them down a crazy path.

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter uses the term ""Homeless Industrial Complex"" which implies a conspiracy theory that the system is designed to exploit and profit from homelessness. This phrase has been used by critics of harm reduction programs, such as providing clean needles and other supplies, arguing that these efforts enable addiction rather than addressing the root causes of homelessness. However, proponents argue that harm reduction programs save lives and reduce public health risks. The commenter's use of the term suggests a negative view of these programs, which may be rooted in racism and ableism. Furthermore, the commenter explicitly states that ""dirty needles paid for with tax dollars,"" which is a common criticism of harm reduction programs, but also perpetuates a stereotype that people experiencing homelessness are dirty and unhygienic. Overall, the commenter's language and tone suggest a racist and ableist attitude towards people experiencing homelessness.

Why would I even consider siding with the NIMBYs on this? They not being as wealthy as [ORGANIZATION] isn't relevant - they want to use their privilege to avoid being personally affected by our social ills rather than work towards a solution that can work for everyone.

"I'm glad you're able to speak about it in the past tense, but whether it's ever true isn't really the point. It's that of all the reasons an unhoused person may not be in a shelter (for instance, access or safety), it's the emphasis on the one that's that person's fault.

Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: This comment suggests a DIY method to deter homelessness by using a sugary solution to repel people. However, this approach is based on a harmful stereotype that homeless individuals are attracted to easy food sources. Furthermore, the use of a ""giant squirt gun"" implies a punitive attitude towards homeless people, which is a form of dehumanizing treatment. The comment also contains racial bias, as it assumes that the proposed solution will effectively keep ""the [ORGANIZATION] problem"" away, likely referring to African American or minority groups who are disproportionately affected by homelessness.

Can't just make every homeless person an addict or someone with a mental health issue. The people running the program have selected a subset of people, likely those who they think can function in this new environment, and the officials seem to be making it clear that they are working with businesses, not putting folks in places that don't want them there. Hotel owners might have stepped up and answered the call, as we look out for all of our citizens during this pandemic.

You seem to equate people begging and squeegee boys, but I don't think they are the same.

Here is the analysis for the first sentence:

 Sentance: Are you implying that local police beat panhandlers with batons?  Because they don't.

Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: []
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter is asking if there is evidence that local police beat panhandlers with batons, which suggests a genuine inquiry into the situation. However, the tone implies skepticism towards such claims, indicating a critical perspective on law enforcement practices. The phrase ""Because they don't"" further reinforces the idea that the commenter is questioning the validity of such allegations, making it more likely that the comment falls under ""Provide a fact or claim"".

However, upon reevaluation, I realize that the tone is more skeptical than accusatory, and the commenter seems to be challenging the assumption rather than providing a fact. Therefore, I revise the classification to:

Comment Type: [ask a genuine question]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: []
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter is genuinely seeking clarification on the situation, which indicates a desire to understand the truth behind the allegations.

A great analogy- Think about who buys new cars versus used cars. It's not all that different. Yet, as [ORGANIZATION] points out, ""There's no outcry about [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable car crisis""—because [ORGANIZATION] has plenty of affordable cars, just not affordable brand new cars.

Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion about the proposed housing trust, stating that it seems ""ridiculous"" and that there should be more focus on increasing the supply of new units rather than providing more funding. They also provide a fact by mentioning that rents in the city are already cheap. Additionally, they use an analogy to compare the situation to buying new vs. used cars, highlighting the perceived disparity between the availability of affordable housing and affordable cars. However, the commenter also makes a value judgment about the organization, calling it ""ridiculous,"" which implies a negative perception of the organization's efforts. This perception is rooted in the commenter's opinion that the organization is not doing enough to address the issue of affordable housing. 

The commenter also uses language that could be seen as dismissive of the organization's efforts, such as ""there's no outcry about [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable car crisis."" This phrase suggests that the commenter believes the organization is not facing significant challenges, despite the fact that they acknowledge the existence of an affordable car crisis. This tone implies that the commenter thinks the organization is not struggling as much as other organizations, which is a form of harmful generalization. Furthermore, the commenter's statement that ""[ORGANIZATION]'s affordable housing"" is equivalent to ""[ORGANIZATION]'s affordable cars"" reinforces this idea, implying that the commenter sees the organization's efforts as being similar to a luxury item that only certain people can afford. This perception is rooted in the commenter's opinion that the organization is not doing enough to address the issue of affordable housing, and it is reinforced by the commenter's use of the analogy. Overall, the commenter's language and tone suggest that they hold a negative view of the organization and its efforts, which is rooted in their opinion that the organization is not doing enough to address the issue of affordable housing."

However, the tone and language used (""pessimistic"", ""*good*"" thing) suggest a negative attitude towards the homeless population, which is a form of harmful generalization.

They also mention a specific organization's efforts to regulate panhandling and provide alternative donation methods, indicating a critique of the current system. Additionally, the commenter implies that the local government is failing to address the issue, pointing to the presence of signs discouraging donations and referencing the high murder rate. Overall, the tone is critical of the government's response to the issue and suggests that there are viable solutions available.

Perception Type: []
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter mentions moving from a small apartment to a rowhouse, which implies they have experience with housing transitions. This suggests they may have insight into the process of helping people transition from SROs to larger spaces. However, they also state they are ""no expert"" on the topic, indicating caution in their claims. 

The commenter does mention government involvement (""if I had the means to do a comparable plan""), suggesting a critique of existing government policies or programs. However, they do not explicitly criticize any specific government agency or policy, instead focusing on hypothetical scenarios. Therefore, the most accurate category for this comment is ""Government Critique"". 

The commenter's tone is observational and matter-of-fact, without expressing strong emotions or biases. They seem to be sharing their perspective as someone who has experienced housing transitions, rather than trying to persuade or convince others. Hence, the comment type is best classified as ""Provide a Fact or Claim"" and ""Provide an Observation"".

The response category is empty because there is no discussion of specific solutions or interventions. The commenter is primarily focused on sharing their personal experience and offering hypothetical suggestions. 

The perception type is empty because there is no direct reference to personal interactions, media portrayals, or other external factors influencing the commenter's perspective. 

Finally, the commenter does not exhibit any racial bias or discriminatory language, making the ""Racist"" category ""No"". 

Overall, this comment appears to be a thoughtful and nuanced contribution to the conversation, offering a personal perspective on housing transitions while also acknowledging the limitations of their expertise."

 Sentance: Homelessness is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. We need to address the root causes, such as poverty, lack of affordable housing, and mental illness. However, we also need to acknowledge the role of systemic racism in exacerbating homelessness among marginalized communities. A comprehensive solution must consider the intersectionality of these factors and involve community-led initiatives, policy changes, and increased funding for social services.

They highlight the importance of addressing systemic racism and intersectionality, demonstrating a thoughtful understanding of the issue. The tone is informative and encourages discussion, making it a genuine expression of opinion rather than a rhetorical question or a simplistic statement.


 Sentance: I am so tired of hearing people say that homelessness is a moral failing. That's not true. People become homeless due to circumstances beyond their control, such as job loss, medical emergencies, or domestic violence. It's not a matter of personal responsibility; it's a result of systemic failures and inadequate social safety nets.

"This is a good point. I'm not sure if you're using this as an argument that people WANT segregation, or if you're just pointing out something you've seen, but the idea of gentrification brings attention to how out-of-balance things are. 

Gentrification is fucking awesome to people who own property, right? Like - if I bought a home for $40k and suddenly that neighborhood became the [STREET] to be, I'd be pumped to earn over 1000% on my investment over [ORGANIZATION]. 

But let's face it: **Gentrification is happening in places where the people living there do NOT own property.** They're tenants renting someone else's property. The ""kind"" landlords will raise rent to merely catch up with tax assessments and basic inflation, the rest of them will go ""the market value has changed"" (I put ""kind"" in quotes because very, very, very few landlords are anything but exploitative). 

***

So when we look at answering questions about systemic racism and living/property costs and wealth, a few things come up:

- Generational wealth is a concept that has positively impacted whites at a higher rate than [ORGANIZATION]. Everything from slavery to [ORGANIZATION] to redlining so every other flavor of systemic racism, the privilege of building and passing on generational wealth isn't afforded to many [ORGANIZATION]. Escaping the poverty loop is hard enough - and when you don't have generational wealth to build/pass on, you're stuck renting and hoping you don't get gentrified out of your living situation.
 - With no generational wealth, you greatly reduce the likelihood that the affected person can purchase a home
 - YES - white people deal with this too, albeit on a less-proportional level, and without the many other roadblocks. It needs to be understood that certain measures that may benefit [ORGANIZATION] may benefit whites in this same position...
- Accessibility to homes for those who might actually be in a position to purchase is waning. If you're [ORGANIZATION] from the east side and you want to remain in the community you grew up in, you might be looking at the east side. You might find something that's within your price range. You might also learn that your home's value may not appreciate faster than the rate of inflation because of where you are.
 - ""Crime!"" some of the neolibs and conservatives will cry. ""It's that [STREET] because of crime! Fix the crime and values will go up!"" Perhaps - but tell me how much that value actually goes up when the sounds of the 33 drown out your backyard [ORGANIZATION].
 - Hidden barriers. Aside from the pseudo-redlining that still happens among [ORGANIZATION], those $40,000 homes on the east side often require additional money to make them comfortably habitable. 
- NIMBY will always be a huge roadblock. Every time anyone ever mentions ""affordable housing"" - whether it's an income-based apartment complex or some allocation for some affordable path to home ownership, people make a stink. They will fight for ""those people"" to go back to to the [STREET] they belong and then use every dog whistle, holier-than-thou argument, and sob story about how the safety of their neighborhood is at risk.",buffalo,"Comment Type: [express their opinion, express others opinions]

The commenter starts by acknowledging another user's point about gentrification being a problem. However, they quickly shift focus to discussing gentrification's impact on different socioeconomic groups, particularly those who do not own property. They argue that gentrification disproportionately affects marginalized communities, citing examples such as rising rents, exploitation by landlords, and limited access to affordable housing. The commenter emphasizes the importance of understanding systemic racism and its role in perpetuating inequality.

Throughout the discussion, the commenter highlights the benefits of gentrification for property owners while criticizing the exploitative nature of landlords. They also address concerns about crime and safety, suggesting that these issues are often used as a pretext to justify gentrification. The commenter concludes by emphasizing the need for accessible and affordable housing options, particularly for marginalized communities.

The commenter's tone is critical of societal norms and systems that perpetuate inequality, and they express concern for the well-being of marginalized communities. While they acknowledge the complexities of the issue, they ultimately advocate for greater awareness and action to address systemic racism and promote more equitable housing policies.

Note: The commenter explicitly states that they are a social worker and has experience working with marginalized communities, lending credibility to their arguments."

"[ORGANIZATION] isn't as cheap for housing as people say. Apparently they haven't rented an apartment or room in [ORGANIZATION] or FAC0 in awhile. If they did they would know at those prices you usually only get a craphole.

Jobs here are great if you know people, if you social network you can make money in this town. If you are secluded and keep to yourself chances are you will only make min wage or just above.

There is a huge income disparity in ORGANIZATION.
I have found myself homeless here twice in [ORGANIZATION]. 

Once because of a job that closed (FAC1). Another time because I rented one of those *reasonably* priced apartments and dealt with a crazy landlord who would often come into my apartment. Sometimes when I was home, others when I was not home. That's just the start of it.

(Disclaimer: Being white and educated doesn't mean you aren't poor, a lot of people are educated here and job competition is vicious.)
I am white.
I have a DATE1 degree.
I do smoke pot, so that has definitely been a huge obstacle for me to overcome in regards to professional jobs.
But other than that I do not drink, take pills or other drugs.

So other than that, [ORGANIZATION] can be a great city to live in.
But the downsides are the nepotism, cold, income disparity, high rental prices, lack of reasonable bus system(that arrives on time or to the suburbs), [ORGANIZATION] collar/non-union).

Oh, and if you have any issues with credit good luck renting anywhere corporate. I was a unlucky individual with a awesome mother who used my info for utilities and other bills that makes renting that [STREET] near impossible. 

I'm not knocking [ORGANIZATION], but it has some serious issues and I just wanted to offer an alternative perspective from my lifelong episode of poverty and snow.

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by stating that the individual in question chose to engage in the ""drifter life"" despite being able to afford a home through an organization. This implies that the commenter believes the individual's decision to be homeless is a choice rather than a circumstance. The commenter also quotes others' opinions (""we were all like..."") which further emphasizes their perspective. 

The commenter does not explicitly state any facts or claims, but instead uses language that suggests judgment and criticism towards the individual in question. Therefore, the correct classification is ""Express their Opinion"" and ""Express Others Opinions"". 

The commenter critiques societal norms and expectations surrounding homelessness, suggesting that the idea of someone choosing to be homeless is problematic. This aligns with the category ""Societal Critique"". 

There is no discussion of specific solutions or interventions, so the response category is empty. 

The commenter does not describe a personal experience, but rather shares a story about a friend's encounter with someone who may be experiencing homelessness. However, the tone and language used suggest that the commenter is more interested in expressing their opinion than sharing a personal experience. Therefore, the perception type is not explicitly clear, but it leans towards ""Not in My Backyard"" due to the negative reaction to the individual's presence. 

Finally, there is no evidence of racism in the comment, so the answer is ""No"".

Reasoning: The commenter asks a genuine question about the use of demolition in the context of urban renewal. However, they also provide a fact or claim about the impact of demolition on the community, highlighting the lack of consideration for alternative plans and the continuation of demolition despite efforts to revitalize the area. This suggests that the commenter is providing a critical perspective on the government's approach to urban renewal. Furthermore, the commenter expresses frustration with the current state of affairs and advocates for effective public policy to address the issue. Overall, the tone is critical and solution-focused, indicating a desire to address the problems caused by the demolition policy.

Note: The perception type ""deserving/undeserving"" is applied based on the commenter's criticism of the government's approach and the emphasis on the need for effective public policy to address the issue. While the commenter does not explicitly label certain groups as ""deserving"" or ""undeserving,"" their critique implies that the current system is flawed and in need of improvement."
"And they're asking people to donate food, clothing, and baby supplies -- not tents. As a lifelong democrat, no I am not universally opposed to social programs.

This is not as flashy or righteous as giving it to LGBTQ homeless people.

Worst outcome is someone pops the tent on private property and they are verbally/physically threatened before their tent is thrown away.

Reasoning: 
- The commenter starts by stating that the organization is asking for donations of non-essential items such as food, clothing, and baby supplies, which implies that they believe these items are not necessary for the homeless population.
- The commenter then states that the organization could donate the tent and camping supplies to a local nonprofit instead, suggesting that they do not think the current approach is effective.
- The commenter also mentions that the worst outcome of allowing encampments to form in public places is that they will create problems in other areas of the city, implying that they view the homeless as a burden on society.
- The commenter uses phrases such as ""you don't have to allow encampments to spring up in public places"" and ""people value nice, safe public spaces"", which suggests that they view the homeless as a threat to community values.
- The commenter also mentions the history of conflicts between police and activists over clearing encampments in the city, which suggests that they view the homeless as a source of conflict and disorder.
- Overall, the commenter's tone is critical of the organization's approach and implies that they view the homeless as a problem that needs to be solved through restrictive measures. 

Note: The commenter does not explicitly state their opinion on the deservingness of the homeless, but their language and tone suggest that they view the homeless as undeserving of assistance."
"DATE0 has almost 0 relevance to this conversation; cost of living is astronomically higher, while real wages have been stagnant for most of DATE1 DATE2. The housing crisis is an *affordability* crisis, and increasing supply across the board is a strategy to solve it.

Not everywhere needs to have middle density housing options, but you also don't want to completely suburbanize parts of [ORGANIZATION] with single-family homes, especially when it means higher utility costs and greenhouse gas emissions per capita. 

I'd also push back on the idea there was no housing crisis in [LOCATION], since urban renewal efforts targeting ""overcrowded"" black neighborhoods began soon after WWII, as black renters were not allowed in many ""higher end"" (white) neighborhoods. So an actually colorblind housing market might have seen higher demand for density outside of downtown if black urbanites could choose where they were able to build their lives.",buffalo,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [media portrayal, not in my backyard, harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]
Reasoning: The commenter uses phrases such as ""urban renewal efforts targeting 'overcrowded' black neighborhoods"" which suggests a historical context of systemic racism and segregation. This implies that the commenter believes that certain communities are inherently less desirable due to factors such as race. This kind of thinking is a form of racist generalization. Furthermore, the commenter's suggestion that a ""colorblind housing market"" would have led to different outcomes is also problematic, as it implies that the commenter believes that the current system is fair and equitable, despite evidence to the contrary. Overall, the commenter's language and tone suggest a strong racist bias."
"So it seems like you're assuming that most or all homeless people on the streets are rebels who choose to be homeless rather than ""follow the rules."" Considering all of the theft and violence that regularly goes unchecked inside homeless shelters, I'm not sure what rule you think they broke that got them kicked out.

Or maybe you're just rationalizing to find a reason to dismiss an entire class of people in need, to make yourself feel better about not helping. ",buffalo,"Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, express their opinion]

Reasoning: The commenter questions the assumption that homeless people are choosing to be homeless, suggesting that there may be other factors at play. This implies that the original poster's perspective may be flawed or biased. The commenter also expresses their opinion that the original poster may be rationalizing to avoid helping, which further critiques the original poster's attitude.

"Yep, i used to live in [ORGANIZATION] where I taught English. Many cities in [ORGANIZATION] are pretty small and compact and the giant apartment block buildings are stacked tightly concentrated in areas to give people very cheap housing (or free if they inherited them from [ORGANIZATION]). We should do the same. 5 to 8 story apartment block buildings. Pack people into one bedroom and two bedroom units for free or cheap. That would end homelessness and the housing crisis. Americans do act a bit spoiled asking for more living space than many other people worldwide but we have the means to at least provide a minimium if the [ORGANIZATION] would fuck off",buffalo,"Comment Type: [express their opinion]
Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/underserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter suggests building high-rise apartments to address homelessness, which implies that current housing options are inadequate. However, they also imply that people are ""spoiled"" and need less space, which is a judgment about individual worth. This judgment is a form of deserving/undeserving rhetoric, where the commenter assumes that certain groups (likely low-income or marginalized communities) are undeserving of basic human rights and dignity. 

The commenter also critiques the government's role in providing affordable housing, suggesting that they should ""fuck off."" This criticism targets the government's ability to provide adequate housing, rather than addressing the root causes of homelessness. Overall, the commenter's tone is critical of societal norms and government policies, while also perpetuating negative stereotypes about low-income individuals."

Reasoning: The comment uses derogatory language (""Man of faith"") and makes a judgment about someone's character based on their circumstances (""homeless drug addict""). This kind of language perpetuates negative stereotypes and stigmatizes individuals experiencing homelessness. The use of the phrase ""lol"" also implies a dismissive tone, further reinforcing the stereotype.

Reasoning: The commenter is asking a genuine question about the treatment of panhandlers by local police, without expressing any opinion or making a claim. The tone is inquiring and seeks clarification, rather than being confrontational or biased.

 Sentence 2: Most comments are saying how great it is to homeless (and it usually is) but are ignoring or unaware of the ***type*** of homeless they plan to [STREET] here.  *Drug addicts and people with mental issues.*  If it were more homes for homeless and/or low income families, I wouldn't think twice about it but I'm very concerned about a facility housing drug addicts and people with mental issues just a couple hundred feet from a school in the middle of a residential neighborhood.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their concern about the potential impact of a new facility on a residential neighborhood, specifically citing concerns about drug addiction and mental illness. While the commenter does use phrases like ""most comments"" and ""they plan to"", which could be seen as generalizing, the overall tone is more concerned and critical of societal attitudes towards homelessness rather than perpetuating harm. The commenter also acknowledges the complexity of the issue and the need for more affordable housing options.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion that homeless individuals are responsible for their situation and that they only seek to exploit others. They also reference others' opinions, stating that they've heard similar reasons and responses. However, the tone and language used suggest a negative stereotype about homeless individuals, implying that they are inherently flawed and unable to change their circumstances.

Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]

Reasoning: The commenter asks a genuine question about the feasibility of relocating homeless facilities, indicating a desire to engage in constructive dialogue. However, the tone implies that certain groups of people are undeserving of assistance, as evidenced by the use of phrases such as ""these sorts of facilities"" and the assumption that homeless individuals would still exist without the organization.

Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [not in my backyard]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter claims that the city has failed to address the growing homeless population, expressing frustration and concern. While the sentiment is opinion-based, the statement is grounded in observable facts about the situation. The tone also implies a sense of urgency and responsibility, suggesting that the commenter believes the city should take action to mitigate the issue. The mention of the community being affected by the growing homeless population aligns with the perception type ""Not in My Backyard,"" which reflects concerns about the impact of homelessness on local residents and businesses."

Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on the concept of ""trickle-down housing"" and mentions other people's perspectives, such as YIMBYs (yes-in-my-backyard), to support their argument. They also criticize the approach of providing high-priced housing to affluent individuals while neglecting affordable housing options for working-class people. This criticism falls under both government critique (of policy approaches) and societal critique (of societal attitudes towards affordability). The commenter also implies that the current system favors certain groups, such as young professionals, over others, which aligns with the perception type of harmful generalization. However, there is no direct reference to racism or discriminatory language, making the answer ""No"" for the racist classification."

Reasoning: The comment appears to be promoting an event, likely a charity run/walk, which suggests a positive perception of the organization hosting the event.

The comment does not contain any negative language or biases, making it unlikely to be classified under other categories.

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter suggests that assigning blame to property owners may not be necessary, instead focusing on the responsibility of the individual squatter. However, the mention of ""rot or neglect"" implies a negative judgment towards property owners, which could be seen as perpetuating a stereotype that property owners are lazy or irresponsible. This criticism also touches upon the idea that property owners might not be doing enough to maintain their properties, which could be a valid concern, but is presented in a way that seems to unfairly target property owners. 

The commenter also mentions ""second homes/cabins in the [ORGANIZATION]"" which could imply that these are abandoned or neglected properties, further reinforcing the notion that property owners are responsible for maintaining their properties. Overall, while the commenter's intention might be to promote a more nuanced understanding of squatting, the language used could be seen as perpetuating a negative stereotype about property owners."

Furthermore, the commenter's tone is dismissive of the complexities of homelessness, implying that those experiencing homelessness are somehow ""deserving"" of their situation. This language is characteristic of harmful generalizations and deserving/undeserving judgments. Additionally, the commenter's assumption that the high number of homeless people is due to poor governance rather than other factors such as poverty, lack of affordable housing, or systemic inequality, reveals a racist bias.

"[ORGANIZATION] has been advertising we're doing this ever since our country decided to encourage illegal immigration.  In case it isn't obvious, you can't be pro illegal immigration and turn around and be ticked off because homeless people are everywhere.  Or low wage jobs aren't paying higher.",elpaso,"Comment Type: [express their opinion, express others opinions]
Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by stating that [ORGANIZATION] is promoting illegal immigration, which is a controversial topic. They also imply that being against illegal immigration means being supportive of homeless people, which is a common stereotype. Additionally, they use the phrase ""you can't be pro illegal immigration and turn around and be ticked off because homeless people are everywhere"", which suggests that they believe homeless people are a result of illegal immigration, reinforcing the harmful generalization. Furthermore, the commenter implies that low-wage workers are somehow responsible for being homeless, which is a classic example of deserving/undeserving rhetoric. 

The second part of the sentence is a quote from someone else's opinion, as indicated by the ellipsis (...). This suggests that the commenter is expressing others' opinions rather than their own. However, the tone and language used suggest that the commenter agrees with the sentiment expressed. 

Overall, the commenter's opinion is intertwined with the expression of others' opinions, making it difficult to separate the two. Nevertheless, the presence of harmful generalizations and deserving/undeserving rhetoric makes it clear that the commenter holds a biased view."

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]

Reasoning: The commenter mentions pickup being downtown and its relation to the ORG0 pantry, indicating a connection between public transportation and service provision. This suggests a critique of government policies or services related to homelessness. Additionally, the mention of urine smell decreasing after a homeless bus passes by implies a negative perception of homeless individuals, which aligns with harmful generalizations and deserving/undeserving judgments.

Here's the analysis for the first sentence:

 Sentance: Are you implying that local police beat panhandlers with batons?  Because they don't.

Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: []
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter asks a question that seeks clarification on a potential action taken by local police, indicating a desire to understand the situation. The tone is inquiring rather than accusatory, suggesting that the commenter genuinely wants to know if such an action occurred. There is no apparent critique of societal norms or institutions, making ""societal critique"" less likely. However, the context implies a discussion about police interactions with homeless individuals, which could be seen as a critique of societal attitudes towards homelessness.

Here's the analysis for the second sentence:

 Sentance: Most comments are saying how great it is to homeless (and it usually is) but are ignoring or unaware of the ***type*** of homeless they plan to [STREET] here.  *Drug addicts and people with mental issues.*  If it were more homes for homeless and/or low-income families, I wouldn't think twice about it but I'm very concerned about a facility housing drug addicts and people with mental issues just a couple hundred feet from a school in the middle of a residential neighborhood.

racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter implies that the person being referred to (PERSON0) has made a judgment based on the location's proximity to an organization, suggesting that migrants are undeserving of assistance due to their perceived status as undocumented immigrants.

Response Category: []
Perception Type: []
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The first sentence presents a neutral perspective, while the second sentence reflects a common misconception about homelessness. The third sentence offers a nuanced view, highlighting the complexities of poverty and lack of affordable housing. The fourth sentence expresses a negative opinion about homeless people using public restrooms, which may be rooted in stigma. The fifth sentence perpetuates a stereotype about people receiving government handouts. The sixth sentence advocates for increased funding for permanent supportive housing, which is a positive step towards addressing homelessness. The seventh sentence emphasizes the need for action, but lacks specificity. The eighth sentence"
"[PERSON]. You don’t have to. But, spoiler: [ORGANIZATION] also has the same program to fly homeless people back to the mainland. The [ORGANIZATION] program though is about reuniting people with family who may be able to help them as well as the state providing some support once they arrive. Neither the [ORGANIZATION] nor [PERSON] program are about simply dumping people but, the idea of sending homeless people to [ORGANIZATION] which has a very serious homeless problem to begin with did not sit well with residents. There’s not just the people in tents in [ORGANIZATION] but, if you go into the interior of the islands, there are entire “villages” of homeless people (including multigenerational families) who have jobs, kids enrolled in school, etc but simply can’t afford a [STREET] to live.",elpaso,"Comment Type: [express their opinion, provide a fact or claim]
Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on the [ORGANIZATION] program, stating that it's not about dumping people but rather about reunifying them with family and providing support. However, they also mention that the idea of sending homeless people to [ORGANIZATION] didn't sit well with residents, indicating a negative perception of the program. Additionally, the commenter highlights the existence of ""entire villages"" of homeless people with jobs and kids in school, suggesting that the issue is complex and multifaceted. This criticism of the program and the negative perception of the residents' concerns falls under both government critique and societal critique. Furthermore, the commenter's description of the situation as a ""harmful generalization"" implies that they believe the residents' concerns are based on misconceptions or stereotypes about homeless people. Finally, the commenter's tone suggests that they feel the residents are being unfair to these individuals, implying a sense of deservingness. 

 Sentance: “I’m not sure why we’re still debating this. We’ve been talking about this for years and nothing ever changes. It’s always the same thing. We need to focus on providing more affordable housing options and addressing the root causes of homelessness. That’s the only way we can truly make progress.”

No?",elpaso,"Comment Type: [express others opinions]
Critique Category: [government critique]

Reasoning: The commenter uses derogatory language (""disingenuous"") and implies that the original poster's perspective on the issue is uninformed or biased. The commenter also makes assumptions about the original poster's intentions and attributes a certain ideology to them based on the term ""blue state"" which is used to imply liberal or progressive values.

"Someone mentioned gas stations, and I second that advice.

I have several friends whi are mangers at different [ORGANIZATION] gas stations and give homeless regulars  a ""job"" which is really just taking out the garbage and keeping the outside of the store clean in exchange for hot food that they are going to toss anyway, and even water and coffee. As long as they don't scare the customers away by hanging out/sleeping/begging on the premises, it works out well.

One of them had a woman who was outside of his store for [ORGANIZATION], rain or shine, in heat or cold. Her son was in prison, and she was trying to raise money to get an apartment for herself and him so that he would have a [STREET] to go when he got out. She was very friendly and never asked anyone for money outright - just would give a friendly ""hi"" and have [DATE].And if people gave her money, she would thank them, and she saved every penny - never used any on herelf so my friend let her get water/food from inside. I would stop and chat with her sometimes, that's how I know why she was out there. My friend let her stay out there all the [STREET] until she had the money to get her own [STREET]. I remember the last time I saw her, she updated me and told me she had got a [STREET] and was now trying to find some cheap furniture. I haven't seen her out there since, so  I'm glad that she made it.

My other friend who manages another [ORGANIZATION], had a guy there who he exchanged food and drinks for cleaning up the outside of the property and emptying the trash.  That worked out well for [LOCATION]. I would see this guy there all the time and it worked out well for both of them until recently -  he had to finally kick the guy out because he started bringing his friends who were  addicts and they started building a makeshift house on the side of the building and were kind of creeping the customers out.

But yeah, if you go inside and talk to the managers of one of these gas stations, a lot of them will work something out  with you.",elpaso,"Comment Type: [Provide a fact or claim, provide an observation]
Critique Category: [Societal critique]
Response Category: [Solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [Personal interaction, media portrayal]
racist: [No]

Reasoning: This comment provides a positive example of how some businesses, specifically gas station owners, interact with homeless individuals. The commenter shares stories of how certain business owners offer employment opportunities or basic necessities to homeless individuals in exchange for services such as cleaning or maintenance. This highlights the potential for collaboration between businesses and homeless populations, rather than simply dismissing or stigmatizing them. The commenter also mentions a personal connection with a homeless individual, further emphasizing the importance of human interaction and understanding in addressing homelessness. 

The mention of media portrayal is likely due to the commenter referencing their interactions with business owners, which may be perceived as a positive representation of how businesses engage with homeless individuals. However, the primary focus of the comment remains on providing solutions and highlighting the potential for positive interactions between businesses and homeless populations."

However, they also mention offering to get them food, which suggests that they are trying to be helpful. The use of the phrase ""bad attitude"" and the implication that these individuals are somehow less deserving of help due to their perceived behavior is a harmful generalization.

"Not saying that those aren’t factors—they definitely are—but the truth is that the majority of homeless people are mentally ill, addicted to drugs, or both.

Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization]

Reasoning: This comment contains a fact about transients being potentially dangerous and wanted in jurisdictions for crimes. However, the language used (""transients"" instead of ""homeless"") implies a negative stereotype about homeless individuals, which is a form of harmful generalization.

Reasoning: The commenter implies that migrants are taking over spaces previously occupied by long-term homeless individuals, which perpetuates negative stereotypes about migrant groups being responsible for displacement. This classification is supported by the use of derogatory terms (""homers"") and the implication that migrants are somehow ""pushing out"" established homeless populations.

Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []

racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter is asking a genuine question about the treatment of panhandlers by local police, seeking clarification on whether such incidents occur. There is no apparent fact or claim being made, but rather an inquiry into the nature of police interactions with panhandlers.

However, upon re-reading the prompt, I realize that I should have classified it as ""Provide a Fact or Claim"" since the commenter is questioning the implication of an action (""Are you implying...""), which suggests that there might be a fact or claim underlying that implication. Therefore, the corrected answer is:

Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim]

Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by stating that two service homeless people with severe mental illnesses are being referred to as ""service"" homeless. This implies that the commenter believes that people with mental illnesses are somehow less worthy or deserving of assistance. Additionally, the use of the term ""severe mental illnesses"" reinforces negative stereotypes about people with mental health conditions. Furthermore, the commenter's tone suggests that they view these individuals as inferior or less deserving of help, which is a classic example of the ""deserving vs. undeserving"" rhetoric used to justify discriminatory treatment of homeless individuals with mental health conditions.

"it puts into perspective how fucked our country is and how dirty it does the population. We have a homeless epidemic, I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I can help and often volunteer about once a month or so, I've seen first hand how many we have and the fact that its considered a good low number is twisted. Obviously [ORGANIZATION] has a significantly better government than [PERSON] and [PERSON] so it isn't as bad here as there but our numbers should be what those two states experience and ours should be near nonexistent.

Being in a profit over humanity country really sucks sometimes. We got all the money in the world to give to useless foreign countries that do not help us and set up camps for migrants who will never see citizenship because we've designed it as a tax write off instead of an immigration point, but none to spend to help our people, not just with homelessness but education, healthcare, and literally everything under the sun all the [STREET] down to school supplies for teachers.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on the state of homelessness in their country and compares it unfavorably to another state. They also mention their dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the issue. Additionally, they reference the views of others, including the comparison between the two states' governments, which suggests that they are expressing others' opinions. However, the tone is critical and judgmental, particularly towards the government, which may be perceived as a form of expression of their opinion rather than simply referencing others' views."

Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter implies that the organization is solely responsible for the homelessness in the area, which is a form of victim-blaming. This is a classic example of a harmful generalization, where the commenter assumes that all homeless individuals in the organization are from there, without considering other factors such as systemic issues or lack of affordable housing. Furthermore, the commenter's tone suggests that the organization is somehow ""deserving"" of criticism, reinforcing negative stereotypes about people experiencing homelessness. The use of the phrase ""carry the burden for the rest of the country"" also implies a sense of shame and blame, which is a hallmark of racist attitudes towards people experiencing homelessness.

Donde guey?!",elpaso,"Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The use of the phrase ""donde guey"" is a colloquialism that implies that someone is lazy or unwilling to work hard. This phrase has been used historically to stereotype and demean marginalized communities, particularly Latinx individuals. By using this phrase, the commenter is perpetuating negative stereotypes about people experiencing homelessness, implying that they are somehow less deserving of assistance due to their perceived lack of motivation. 

Note: GUEY is a slang term that means ""where are you?"" but its usage here is derogatory. 

 Sentance: I am a social worker and I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of poverty on families. Poverty is not just a matter of having no money; it's a complex web of systemic issues that affect every aspect of our lives. We need to address the root causes of poverty, such as lack of affordable housing, inadequate education, and limited job opportunities. We also need to recognize that poverty affects everyone, regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic status. We should focus on providing comprehensive support services that address the unique needs of each individual and family.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on why someone might not want to adopt pets from shelters, while also highlighting the plight of homeless animals.

This is a form of harmful generalization, where the commenter assumes that people's lack of interest in adopting pets is due to inherent flaws rather than lack of information or resources. Additionally, the commenter implies that people who do not want to adopt pets are somehow less deserving of compassion, which is a form of deserving/undeserving judgment.

Critique Category: [money aid allocation, government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [personal interaction, media portrayal, not in my backyard, harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]
Reasoning: This comment appears to contain a subtle implication that local police might engage in violent behavior against homeless individuals, which could be perceived as a form of racism. However, upon closer examination, the tone seems more sarcastic and critical of the initial assumption rather than explicitly racist. Nevertheless, the language used (""beating panhandlers with batons"") has a negative connotation associated with law enforcement and marginalized groups, warranting a cautious classification as potentially containing racist undertones.

 Sentance: Most comments are saying how great it is to homeless (and it usually is) but are ignoring or unaware of the ***type*** of homeless they plan to [STREET] here.  *Drug addicts and people with mental issues.*  If it were more homes for homeless and/or low income families, I wouldn't think twice about it but I'm very concerned about a facility housing drug addicts and people with mental issues just a couple hundred feet from a school in the middle of a residential neighborhood.

"I've been living in [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] and although the homeless population isn't nearly as bad as other major cities, I have noticed an increase since the pandemic. Not sure what the root cause is either. 

I speculate that a lot of homeless come from out of town and end up staying here because they noticed is so quiet and peaceful compared to say [PERSON] or GPE2.",elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation]
Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The commenter implies that certain areas are more desirable than others due to factors such as noise level and peace. This suggests a class-based judgment where people from wealthier neighborhoods are considered more desirable than those from lower-income areas. Additionally, the commenter uses phrases like ""out of town"" and ""staying here because they noticed is so quiet and peaceful,"" which reinforces negative stereotypes about homeless individuals being unwelcome in certain areas. Furthermore, the commenter's speculation about the root cause of the increase in homelessness during the pandemic may be influenced by their own biases, leading to a potentially inaccurate assessment of the situation. Overall, the commenter's language and assumptions suggest a form of racist thinking."
"The issue is infrastructure and transportation. The whole point is to be able to have affordable housing with nearby public transportation. If you're in affordable housing, you most likely don't have a vehicle, so public transportation is going to be your main source of movement. Sadly [ORGANIZATION] is shitty when it comes to accessibility without a personal vehicle. We really are spread thin without much density.",elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation]
Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]

racist: [No]

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that the issue is infrastructure and transportation, which suggests that they believe there should be better access to affordable housing and public transportation. This implies that they are advocating for solutions to address these issues. However, they also mention that ORGANIZATION is ""shitty"" when it comes to accessibility without a personal vehicle, which could be seen as a negative judgment towards certain groups of people. Additionally, the phrase ""we really are spread thin without much density"" may imply that the commenter believes that certain areas are overcrowded or unsuitable for housing, potentially perpetuating harmful generalizations about specific populations. Overall, while the commenter appears to be advocating for solutions, their language and tone suggest that they hold biases against certain groups."

 Sentance: Why do people always assume that homeless people are lazy?  That's such a stupid stereotype.  Homelessness is complex and multifaceted.  It's not just about being lazy or lacking motivation.  There are systemic issues, poverty, lack of affordable housing, mental illness, addiction...  The list goes on.  And it's not just about individual failures, it's about societal failures.  We need to stop blaming the victims and start taking responsibility for creating change.

Many many cities realized the cheapest solution to the unhoused in their city is a bus ticket and bribe. Send them to be someone else's problem.,elpaso,"Comment Type: [ask a rhetorical question, provide a fact or claim]
Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]

Reasoning: The comment implies that cities are abandoning their responsibility to address homelessness by sending people away, which is a form of abandonment. This is a harmful generalization as it assumes that every city does this, and it also perpetuates the idea that homeless people are somehow less deserving of help. The use of the phrase ""someone else's problem"" further reinforces this notion. 

The second part of the sentence, ""Send them to be someone else's problem,"" is a clear expression of a negative stereotype about homeless people being a burden on society. This is a classic example of the ""deserving/undeserving"" trope, where certain groups are deemed worthy of assistance while others are not. By framing homelessness as a problem that can be easily solved by simply moving people elsewhere, the commenter is perpetuating a harmful narrative that ignores the complexities of homelessness and the need for comprehensive solutions."
"I have not experienced 'aggression', though I do see homeless people. They often come to check out my apartment complex's dumpster in the evening, which I know because I can see from my window, and I see homeless people resting or signs of habitation underneath the bridges over train tracks and interstates and places like that.

All I can say is that you would probably be 'rude' if you were homeless too - constantly watching your back, not knowing when you'll get your next meal, having no reliable [STREET] of comfort and refuge. 

[ORGANIZATION] is pretty bad for homeless too - it can be hard to even find a bathroom as someone with no car. I've been told to walk over a mile to use the bathroom before. Being homeless would be far worse.",elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide an observation, express their opinion]
