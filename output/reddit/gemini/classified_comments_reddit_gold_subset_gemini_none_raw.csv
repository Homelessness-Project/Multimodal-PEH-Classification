Are you implying that local police beat panhandlers with batons?  Because they don't .,southbend,"Comment Type: [ask a rhetorical question, provide a fact or claim]

Response Category: []
Perception Type: []
racist: [No]
Reasoning: [The user asks a rhetorical question to challenge an implied statement and then follows it with a direct factual claim (""Because they don't""). The subject is the behavior of the police, which is a government entity, thus fitting the government critique category.]"
"Not a big surprise?

There is not a lack of low paying jobs here. The top needs of the panhandlers is usually mental care, which we as a society really suck at providing. Giving someone with a substance abuse problem or a mental disorder a trashbag and $10 an hour to pick up trash isn't going to do a lot.",southbend,"Comment Type: [ask a rhetorical question, provide a fact or claim, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter begins with a rhetorical question, makes claims about job availability and the needs of panhandlers, and expresses an opinion on the ineffectiveness of low-wage job programs for this group. This represents a critique of society's approach to mental healthcare. By discussing the inadequacy of a specific intervention (low-wage work), it engages with the topic of solutions. The comment makes a harmful generalization by broadly attributing the needs of all panhandlers to mental health and substance abuse issues. The comment does not contain any racial bias."

Reasoning: The user is recounting a past personal experience, stating that people they identify as ""panhandlers"" used to come to their door. This is a direct observation of a personal interaction. The comment does not offer any critique, solution, or contain any racial bias."
"If the city did not want this, they would not have dedicated half of the downtown area to homeless shelters.

Perception Type: []
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter expresses a strong opinion that the proliferation of homeless shelters downtown is an intentional outcome of city policy. This constitutes a critique of the government's approach and its allocation of resources (space/shelters). The comment also includes a broader societal critique by framing these efforts as ""narcissistically institutionalizing compassion."" The comment does not offer solutions, focus on perceptions of PEH, or contain any racial bias."

Reasoning: The comment makes a claim about an organization's work and expresses a positive opinion about its ability to distribute aid. This is presented as a potential solution or intervention, which touches upon the topic of aid allocation. By specifying that resources should go to ""someone who needs it,"" the comment makes a judgment about who is deserving of help based on need. The comment does not contain any racial bias."
"Good call [ORGANIZATION]. Many, not all, of the panhandlers don't want a job. A great deal of them are former residents of FAC0 in town. They are usually out there begging for money to pay for their addiction and put money in their dealers hand.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion (""Good call,"" ""I believe a better option is"") and makes claims about panhandlers' motivations (""don't want a job,"" ""begging for money to pay for their addiction""). This creates a harmful generalization about a group of people and makes a judgment on who is ""truly homeless"" and therefore deserving of help.

Reasoning: The commenter provides a claim about an organized panhandling operation, shares their observation of individuals rotating at a specific corner, and expresses what others who work with the homeless have said and considered doing (alerting media/police). The comment does not critique broader systems or contain any perceptions from the provided list, as it focuses on a specific alleged criminal activity rather than making a generalization. It mentions a potential intervention. There is no racial bias present."
"I experience the same comments with non-benders in my car. It's tough because we want [ORGANIZATION] to be better, and there's been large improvements. But there is still a [ORGANIZATION] of work to be done. At this point, I feel as if the homeless issue is starting to hold back development and other progress in the city, mainly downtown. I can't stress enough how delicate and sensitive of an issue this is for [ORGANIZATION]. Agree or not, we are a liberal city, with quite a few Democrats in charge. The bread of butter of Democrats is poor relief. Is the current situation a result of the current (local) administration/leaders?

I think this issue could actually be a fantastic opportunity for [ORGANIZATION] to step in. They have some of the brightest individuals there, that could use their resesrch expertise, and other knowledge to come with up with a collaborative approach with the City of [ORGANIZATION] to help tackle this problem the right [STREET].

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on the complexity of the homelessness issue, framing it as a systemic problem that holds back city development (Societal Critique).

Reasoning: The comment expresses the opinion and makes the claim that social services are the cause of homelessness (""bum issues"") in the area. This is a critique of how aid/money is allocated and an implicit critique of the government entities that provide those services. The use of the derogatory term ""bums"" is a harmful generalization, and blaming the services for the problem implies a judgment that the people using them are taking advantage of the system and are therefore ""undeserving."" The comment does not contain explicit or implicit racial bias."

Reasoning: The comment makes a claim about the city dedicating a large part of downtown to homeless shelters (a form of resource allocation) and expresses a strong opinion criticizing the motivations behind this action.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses a strong opinion in favor of building a homeless center, framing it as a binary choice and a common-sense solution. It critiques the societal ""Not in my Backyard"" (NIMBY) sentiment by addressing people's fears and potential complaints if the center is not built. It proposes a specific intervention (""build the center"") and humanizes the homeless population (""someone's daughter/son/mother/father"") to counter negative perceptions.

"There are several reasons that someone couldn't stay at center for the homeless but could be at [ORGANIZATION].
Some are innocuous, such for example, [ORGANIZATION] doesn't allow pets, but [ORGANIZATION] does. [ORGANIZATION] is sex segregated so couples can't stay there together, but they can at [ORGANIZATION]. 

But the other big distinction is that [ORGANIZATION] isn't a low barrier shelter, so they have a strick drugs and alcohol policy, which [ORGANIZATION] does not. I'm pretty sure that [ORGANIZATION] also requires residents to participate in mental health and job counseling, which [ORGANIZATION] for now does not.",southbend,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation]

Reasoning: The comment provides factual claims about the differing policies of two organizations that serve the homeless (e.g., rules on pets, couples, substance use, and mandatory counseling).

We will also need to make sure we hold the city's feet to the fire to make sure they fulfill their promises to us and maintain our neighborhood. 

Thankfully this is a little different than a soup kitchen or shelter.

"The meeting was a great showing of varying community opinion. Went from [TIME].

\- PERSON0 got truly irate

\- PERSON1 (mayors office) got called out for unintentionally lying and providing partial information [ORGANIZATION] night to council. [TIME] before the meeting too.

\- The main guy from [ORGANIZATION] said FAC0 started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after [TIME] when there is no presence on site. Some lady from [ORGANIZATION] who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to [LOCATION] and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- [ORGANIZATION] got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until [TIME]) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- [ORGANIZATION] and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- PERSON2 of [ORGANIZATION] berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from ORG2 essentially said the same thing. [ORGANIZATION] also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes [TIME] the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which [ORGANIZATION] said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with [ORGANIZATION] apologized because they were voting against.

\- PERSON4 also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly [ORGANIZATION] employees, and people like PERSON4 who only took up [TIME] total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give [TIME] to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition [TIME]?

\- [ORGANIZATION] had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the [ORGANIZATION] project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the [STREET]. [ORGANIZATION] kept repeating they asked their consultant (DATE2) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as [ORGANIZATION] while giving numerous sites labels of [LOCATION]. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- PERSON6 tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter ([ORGANIZATION]) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""[INSTITUTION]"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. [ORGANIZATION] said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 [PERSON] meetings, 1 of which is attended. The [PERSON] barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in [ORGANIZATION] without a site in mind so then it became urgent in [LOCATION] to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around DATE4. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side?

There would be on site visits from [ORGANIZATION] (recovery coach) but for their caseworker it sounds like they would pick up individuals and bring them to [ORGANIZATION].

I'm curious how large complexes are more harmful? And I also thought [ORGANIZATION] doesn't allow visitors or drugs.

To the point of something outside the city, good luck getting the county to agree to that. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] hate homeless people to the point of calling them garbage. The county commissioners don't want to fund anything that isn't already a running program or a giant corporation trying to move in.

"I like some of his ideas but I have a better chance being a pro basketball player than [ORGANIZATION] does consolidating departments or initiatives with [PERSON]. Him thinking that's possible makes me question if he's just saying that to get away with the ""how will you pay for this"" question than it either shows willful misleading or not understanding the dynamic between the two cities.

He seems to be trying to be the best of both worlds and say ""hey if you like [ORGANIZATION] and where the city is going I'm your guy but also hey [ORGANIZATION] is overrated and the city needs a lot of work"" it's an interesting strategy. I think he actually has a more critical view of [ORGANIZATION] and the city government than he let's on (which there is nothing wrong with) that I wish he would just come out in the open and say so the debate could be better.

Edit - For example it's easy to say the city is ""screwing around"" with the homeless situation, but to not give what you would actually so different. The city had a decent homeless initiative that was stopped by residents in unison saying you're not putting transition centers in ""my neighborhood"". So how do you get past that? What is he going to do to fix the problem besides, say, not screwing around? Whatever that even means. Considering it's a top 3 initiative of his, he's provided no details whatsoever.

Now the situation is so dire that a food train is needed to feed these volunteers. Again, wouldn’t they be better served finding a job? The thing that mainly bothers me, though is the pictures and the videos. We’re talking about people who are in the throes of their addiction, in the middle of detoxing, or fresh out of rehab or suffering from mental illness . Of course if she asked them to take a picture of video they’re going to say yes, they feel obligated to say yes, would be my guess, some of them probably feel like if they don’t say yes, she won’t help them, or they won’t be able to be down there ,or worse be ostracized once again in their lives. . She is a master manipulator and things don’t have to be said, in order to be understood.  Don’t get me started on the children’s picture being blasted out there. For instance, the last one with [ORGANIZATION] and her husband/abuser/trafficker and those poor kids. Now of course they will consent to a picture, because after all [PERSON] saved them!  And it makes complete sense for all their friends and strangers to know the horrors these children endured before their parents got clean. Lastly no one and I mean NO one should be cleaning up a person who has soiled themselves.  They don’t have the facilities for that and not one person, [PERSON] or her homeless volunteers are trained to do that .  Especially to someone in a wheelchair who probably has a multitude of medical issues and if not properly handled could be seriously injured.

Perception Type: [media portrayal, harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter primarily expresses a strong opinion criticizing the actions of a specific person/organization. They make observations about videos and pictures being taken and use a rhetorical question (""wouldn’t they be better served finding a job?"") to make a point. The critique is societal, focused on the ethics and dignity of how help is provided and publicly portrayed, rather than a critique of government or funding. The comment implicitly critiques current interventions (performative help) while suggesting others (job searching, professional care). The perception is shaped by media portrayal (the photos/videos being discussed) and includes a harmful generalization that PEH are misusing their time by volunteering. It also makes a judgment about what PEH *should* be doing, which falls under the deserving/undeserving category. There is no racial bias in the comment."

Reasoning: The commenter provides claims about historical figures' ""good deeds"" to support their opinion that positive actions (like providing food or rehab) do not justify a person's negative actions. The comment critiques the societal tendency to overlook wrongdoing from those who perform charitable acts. It also references the opinions of others (""someone posted this,"" ""someone says""). The ""Deserving/Undeserving"" perception is applied not to people experiencing homelessness, but to the service provider, making a judgment on their moral worthiness to be helping others.

They critique what they see as a societal tendency to frame ""addicts"" as victims.

"So, I've changed a lot on this one over time. I spent [ORGANIZATION] as an advocate working against chronic homelessness, have participated on some of the city's [LOCATION] on homelessness, etc, but I don't think the city, nor this take are being entirely generous.

1 - yes, housing first is scientifically the most effective model for caring for the homeless. It's math, not feelings. It [LOCATION] - but... housing first doesn't give free license to do housing first poorly. there are ways to do zero barrier in ways that are more harmful and less harmful.3 - less harmful = scattered site. less harmful = day shelter programming and a more controlled check in/check out process. more harmful = large complexes. more harmful (to the community) = no day programming, free roaming, full freedom, full visitation (allows for drug dealers)4 - Motels4Now has been good for the homeless, but harmful for many near it. It just has. Businesses have closed, people feel less safe, and it decreases the dignity and pride of the people near it (who - as those on the [ORGANIZATION] side - have already dealt with a lot of disinvestment). I'm not sure it's fair to help some people by harming some others, especially when it's just due to not being willing to produce the funding to do it in a [STREET] that is even more helpful and less harmful.I think at this point my preference would be something outside of city limits, on the edge of town where there's still zero restrictions on sobriety, but still a more programmatic or controlled environment. And let's pay for a shuttle that can connect people to the bus line. Surely a small shuttle bus and a full-time driver is within financial reason, given the total project will cost millions anyway.

I'm not saying my idea is the best one. But we at least have to have some compassion for the real expressed needs of neighbors and business owners without painting them out to be petty or greedy.

Reasoning: The comment is a sarcastic taunt expressing a cynical opinion about panhandlers. It functions as a societal critique by mocking the dynamic between panhandlers and those who give them money.

"Pretty strong rhetoric here. [ORGANIZATION] administers both homeless prevention assistance and housing assistance for thousands of people [ORGANIZATION]. And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. [ORGANIZATION] literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at [TIME] to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG2 does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

I'm very sorry to hear that you're having a hard time keeping up with building codes.

racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter expresses strong opinions about the decline of a city, attributing it to the policies of elected officials (""democrats""), which constitutes a government critique. They ask rhetorical questions to make their point (""Does anyone realize...?""). They critique the use of tax revenue (""money aid allocation""), make claims about past political decisions, and propose a ""solution"" for residents to leave the city. The comment also makes a harmful generalization by broadly associating ""drugs and homeless folks"" as a singular cause of the city's degradation. There is no evidence of racial bias in the comment."

racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter asks both rhetorical questions to critique an organization's methods (e.g., ""when are you going to clean up..."") and genuine questions about shelter capacity and city programs. The comment critiques the organization's allocation of aid (blankets/tents) and the city's process for data tracking and funding. It displays a ""not in my backyard"" perspective by focusing on items being ""dumped"" in the neighborhood and makes a harmful generalization by attributing this behavior to ""the same people."" It implicitly suggests a solution: better data tracking to secure grant funding. There is no evidence of racial bias."

Reasoning: The comment expresses the speaker's opinion, framed as a claim, advocating for a specific solution (affordable housing). This serves as an implicit critique of the city/government for failing to provide adequate housing and a critique of how resources are allocated. The comment focuses on a systemic issue and does not contain any specific perceptions of homeless individuals or racial bias."

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by reacting to a video (media portrayal) from an organization. They critique the organization's methods as exploitative and enabling, which is a societal critique on how to help addicted individuals. By endorsing the ""hit your lowest low"" theory, they discuss a specific (and controversial) intervention philosophy. The comment makes a harmful generalization by labeling the woman a ""prostitute who is on drugs"" and implies that certain help is inappropriate, which is a form of deserving/undeserving judgment. There is no racial bias in the comment."
"A lot of people commenting are assuming the people she's helping have a phone and can call for help themselves. Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss [PERSON]'s bc they know she has [LOCATION] and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break. 

I am not saying that there is or isn't a reason to be concerned, I don't know either [STREET], but some of the comments are petty [ORGANIZATION]. She's asking for immediate donations of food, shows the lack of food and the line of people and when the food is delivered they see the hungry people. She goes live all the time and shows the volunteers, donations and those she's helping. I think she is helping them and that those complaining or questioning haven't proven otherwise. 

I don't see anyone else in the neighborhood helping our most vulnerable residents 24/7 with a sack lunch and no questions asked.

"I will try to save everyone [TIME] of their life by summarizing the Live video.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed a few complaints on her fb page.  First, she addressed the gal who expressed frustration of clothes, personal care bags, food, razors, feminine products being dumped around her home.  The woman asked miss [ORGANIZATION] volunteers to come pick it up since it’s a regular problem.  [ORGANIZATION] addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets [ORGANIZATION] while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.  That doesn’t happen anymore,  but instead it became the neighbors problem.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at [ORGANIZATION]’s a few times and was angry at how she wasn’t helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed it saying it’s because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers aren’t sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her [STREET] is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is [ORGANIZATION] register [ORGANIZATION] may turn out to be a blessing for her, per [ORGANIZATION] (not in those words).  She can’t comment on the article per the board, but so many people have offered support since the article so these things may get addressed by volunteers in the community.  I feel so bad for these businesses being sucked into this when the economy hasn’t been the best for all lines of business.  Do they know she raised $400k for a $175k building?  I also felt bad for the Mexican restaurant donating so many meals DATE2.  I hope the food goes to those that need it, but cash flow at restaurants has been tough since [PERSON] and inflation.

2) I hate the crime and gang violence that spills out of the west side of [PERSON]. it also acts like a catch all for the riff raff coming out of [ORGANIZATION]. the homeless is a growing issue too. 

The roads are crap because you get the worst of [ORGANIZATION] being down well below 0 for [LOCATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] are well above the 90s for [LOCATION]. the springs and falls are nice but its [ORGANIZATION] of each. 

[PERSON] is also a highly industrial area, except that was [PERSON]. alot of empty rusted dilapidated buildings that hipsters start a business in for [PERSON] then go under.

this area is extremely blue collar, the only thing that they like to do is go to bars. Not really a music or art culture here. just bars. 

people here cant [STREET] worth a shit. guys in [ORGANIZATION] are still wearing skater shoes with chain wallets. Moms smoke in their cars with their babies listening to papa roach. 

since they passed a gambling law, there are slots on every corner and in every [STREET] imaginable. They also passed another granting [PERSON] to build a casino [PERSON] or DATE8. So the people that live paycheck to paycheck that already have problems can go to surrender what they have left. But the city gets a bit of the profit, which you'll never see get implemented to benifit you in any [STREET]

"Most of those funds go to programs for housing and homeless prevention.They, for a while, also could go towards temporarily sheltering people. So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for [ORGANIZATION], or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for [LOCATION].  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in [STREET], and certain things that these funds simply can't help with.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on a person/organization, provides facts about their profession as a social worker, and observes issues in a specific area. They discuss solutions like harm reduction and supplying resources. The rhetorical question, ""Have you ever spoken with a forced sex worker or houseless person?"" serves as a societal critique, challenging others to gain firsthand understanding before forming opinions, which is based on the commenter's own personal interactions."

Reasoning: The comment is composed entirely of questions seeking to understand the specifics of a referral and housing placement process. The speaker explicitly states, ""Just trying to understand this process,"" confirming the genuine, inquisitive nature of the comment. It does not offer opinions, critiques, or perceptions, but rather seeks clarification on logistics."
"The city has been practicing the [ORGANIZATION] program for [ORGANIZATION].  What housing first does is provide shelter first, and then addresses the person's other issues.  The city also put a lot of people up in rooms during [PERSON] because they got funding for it.  It makes no sense that [ORGANIZATION] would pay for people's rent. The city has been so successful with [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] is a model for other cities.  The city also collaborates with other agencies to reduce overlap and gaps.  However, the city employees can't post on social media about what they do.  [ORGANIZATION] rarely speaks of the work and programs of the city and other agencies.  

It isn't compassionate to supply people to live rough indefinitely, and put a strain on community spaces when bedding, tents, clothing, and food waste are dumped and abandoned buildings go up in flames.  It is reckless to give people hope that they can live sustainably with a cup of ramen, a few blankets and a tent in [LOCATION].  That is why no other agency in town provided materials to live outdoors, they provide shelter first.  However, the city can't force anyone to accept help, so there will always be un-sheltered people.

racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter provides facts and claims about specific city programs (like ""housing first""), observes the negative community impact of street encampments, and expresses strong opinions that providing materials for outdoor living is not compassionate or effective. The comment critiques the allocation of resources (shelter vs. supplies) and criticizes the city's lack of communication about its work. It advocates for a specific solution (""shelter first"") and provides links to support its claims. The comment focuses on policy and program effectiveness without resorting to harmful generalizations or racial bias."

Perception Type: [not in my backyard]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The comment makes a claim about a specific organization's actions causing the problem. This is a critique of how that organization allocated its resources (by shutting down a center). The phrasing ""sent them to you"" implies a ""not in my backyard"" sentiment, where the problem is seen as being pushed from one location to another. There is no racial bias present in the comment."

Perception Type: [not in my backyard, harmful generalization]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The comment is framed as a rhetorical question to express the speaker's opinion, which they attribute to ""people"" in general. It critiques a societal issue regarding the use of public spaces. The sentiment reflects a ""Not in my Backyard"" attitude by wanting a public park free from a specific group. It also makes a harmful generalization by implying that homeless people as a group inherently harass others. The comment does not contain any racial bias."
"Have you offered your own backyard as a potential location? Or maybe just your couch if you don't have a backyard? I'm sure you have. And a pip pip cheerio to you!

Critique Category: [societal critique]

Perception Type: [not in my backyard]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter uses sarcastic rhetorical questions (""Have you offered your own backyard?"") to express their opinion and critique what they perceive as hypocrisy from others who advocate for homeless aid. This highlights a ""not in my backyard"" (NIMBY) mentality by turning the argument back on the original poster. The comment also sarcastically proposes an individual-level intervention (offering one's own home) to make its point. There is no racial bias present."

Reasoning: The commenter shares a detailed personal observation from their time as a manager, recounting a specific interaction with a person experiencing homelessness. They express both the opinions of the person they knew (e.g., that support structures exist for those who aren't ""degenerates"") and their own belief that the area is known as a supportive community. The mention of ""support structures"" and the idea that one must not be a ""degenerate"" to access them relates to aid allocation and judgments on who is deserving of help. The comment contains no racial bias."
"For context I’m a social work whose full time job it is to help people in [PERSON]. So yes, I am actively trying to help the situation.

Reasoning: The commenter identifies their profession as a social worker, indicating direct personal interaction. They express their opinion and make claims about the root causes of the problem, placing blame on systemic issues like ""lack of structural assistance"" and ""criminalization of homelessness,"" which are critiques of government policy and broader societal structures."

Reasoning: The comment expresses a strong opinion that criminalizing homelessness is inhumane and a misuse of police power, which is a critique of government policy. It also critiques the societal attitude of the person it is responding to, suggesting their anger is misdirected at homeless people. It does not fit any other category and contains no racial bias."

Reasoning: The commenter presents a quote from experts (""those who work closely with the unhoused community"") as a factual claim to debunk societal rumors about how homeless individuals arrive in an area. This directly addresses and attempts to correct a harmful generalization. The comment does not contain any racial bias."

Wealth is not directly correlated with expendable time. The wealthiest people I’ve met and know are some of the busiest people I’ve ever met. They’re always on call and always working. Now that’s not to say the people around them not earning it but enjoying the fruits of the labor don’t have expendable time. There are developers that are building apartments for low income but it’s not at a pace that can keep up with the issue. The creamery and the development on FAC0 for example. Problem is it takes [ORGANIZATION] sometimes to build these structures. I don’t have the answer to the homeless issue but I agree arresting everyone isn’t the answer.

Reasoning: The commenter provides claims about the pace of low-income housing development, observes the state of their downtown based on lifelong residency (a form of personal interaction with the issue's local impact), and expresses their opinion that arrests are not the solution. There is an implicit critique of the slow process for building housing, which often involves government or large organizational bureaucracy. The comment discusses building apartments as an intervention. The comment contains no racial bias."

Reasoning: The commenter provides claims about the status of specific projects (""pods,"" ""organization revamp""), which are a form of intervention. They express their own opinion (""I think"") about the feelings of others (the homeless community's frustration), linking it to delays in these aid projects. This implicitly critiques the allocation and delivery of resources. The comment contains no racial bias or specified perception types."

Reasoning: The commenter poses a series of genuine questions to understand another person's perception of the root causes of homelessness. By asking about childhood and socio-economic background, the questions implicitly frame the issue as a societal one with systemic origins, rather than one of individual failing. The comment does not offer solutions or specific perceptions and contains no racial bias."

This is exactly the issue exemplified in a lot of ways.

* Providing housing is a risky (leveraged) profit-making endeavor rather than a more stable public good
* When people don't have housing, it's much harder for them to actually spend time finding a steady job or other source of income

Reasoning: The commenter uses a quoted observation of a personal interaction (a landlord's experience with housing assistance) to express their opinion on a broader systemic issue. They make a claim about the difficulty of finding a job while unhoused and ask a rhetorical question about accountability to support their societal critique of housing being a for-profit endeavor rather than a public good. The initial quote also touches on the allocation of money for aid. The comment contains no racial bias."

"Yeah, but specifically how? 

Tax rates for the wealthy are going down, not up. As you've seen in [ORGANIZATION] now, passing anything, even with democrats in power, is nearly impossible. Including tax hikes (fun fact: the bill being debated right now - is more than 25% tax cuts. As in the infrastructure bill is more than 25% tax cuts. And the Democrats are...in power, not the Republicans).

People always have simple answers to big problems, and these simple answers solve none of the problems. It is actually.... probably the saddest thing I've witnessed, in general over my life. 

We've said we would solve so much. Climate change, gun violence, equality, social mobility - and we've made zero progress on any of these. We've made negative progress, even. We can't even legalize marijuana at the federal level. 

Here's a simple solution to solving climate change; just do it. Just do it. Easy, right?

People on this subreddit keep asking the same questions, and providing the same simple answers. And yet they are amazed that they are unsatisfied with the results. Here's what the people asking these questions don't want to hear; invite the homeless in to your house. Or take your paycheck, and buy a house for the homeless person, or buy the homeless person a [ORGANIZATION] at a hotel. These are actual solutions that any of us can do. It just takes sacrifice from us. How many of us do you see making these sacrifices? None. 

We literally cannot even raise taxes. So it's just.... exhausting in a sense (trying to... demonstrate the gridlock, the partisanship, the need for solutions that can actually pass [PERSON]).

Reasoning: The commenter expresses a cynical opinion about the feasibility of solving large-scale problems, using homelessness as an example. They critique the government's political gridlock, specifically mentioning the inability to raise taxes on the wealthy (Money Aid Allocation, Government Critique). They also critique society and subreddit users for offering simplistic solutions while being unwilling to make personal sacrifices (Societal Critique, Express Others Opinions).

Reasoning: The commenter expresses the strong opinion that ample resources exist for people experiencing homelessness (PEH), based on their own personal experience with homelessness and conversations with officials. They make a harmful generalization that ""most of them just don't want it, they like the lifestyle,"" which establishes a deserving/undeserving framework. The comment critiques the societal behavior of PEH and the effectiveness of aid allocation, suggesting that the problem is not a lack of resources but a refusal to use them.

This serves as a critique of what the commenter perceives as a pessimistic societal outlook.

They present a specific statistic (""95-99% of homelessness... IS caused by addiction and mental illness"") as a factual claim and express strong, insulting opinions about the other user's ideology. The critique is societal, arguing against a systemic explanation for homelessness by blaming individual pathologies.

For people experiencing homelessness, having an address and stability combats substance use but also provides them an actual chance to become employed.  A job is the silver bullet for many of the issues present; gives them a sense of community and also stable income. I think in [ORGANIZATION] ( lived there for [ORGANIZATION] including [LOCATION]) the issue isn’t physical housing. It’s the individuals living on the streets aren’t able to rent the open properties. By allowing/assisting them to get housed then they can focus on other goals. In [PERSON] and most major cities they utilize a housing-first approach, understanding that people are less likely to get sober or employed if they do not have stable housing. 

If the tents/encampments become more permanent it will cause a multitude of issues we see here in [PERSON]; spread of disease,  crime and, overall the community becomes disenfranchised to do anything. ",kzoo,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion]

The community, but more to the point, land and housing costs are artificially high for reasons I stated in my original comment. Abolish (at the least) corporate landlords and see where the chips fall. I suspect the cost of living would be much better for everyone, myself a homeowner included.

The same ones that maintain it now - contractors. at best, landlords serve as a (very expensive) middleman between the tenet and the contractor.

"I get what you’re saying, but free phones and phone service can be easy to obtain. The government cellphones don’t cost a thing. I see booths set up around my part of town (e. FAC0) that encourage people to come sign up for a free phone. 

And tbh the world of technology we live in now considers a cell phone to be a basic need, and rightfully so. There aren’t any more pay phones, or they are at least few and far between. Society is dependent on technology. Being homeless is hard enough. I despise that these asshats ruined the park for such a long time, but they are people. They are humans. They are important to someone, even if they aren’t even a blip on my radar, every person in that park has value and is special and important to someone. They deserve basic human kindness and it is society’s duty to care for and support each other. I am totally ok with my tax dollars being used to buy a phone and service for someone who can’t do it for themselves. Life is already hard enough. We can provide this support to have available basic human needs. 

I do get what you’re saying. I was jealous of the camp sites down there. They got better shit than I do. And I work my ass off to keep my head just above water. But it is a little bit on the ignorant side to just assume that a homeless person should not be entitled to basic needs. Or even something better.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses the opinion that the presence of homeless individuals has made a specific neighborhood unsafe, citing their own childhood experience as a contrast. This reflects a ""Not in my Backyard"" (NIMBY) perspective. The comment uses a rhetorical question (""Would you let your second grader walk..."") to emphasize this perceived danger.

The critique is aimed at the management of a tax-funded public space (Government Critique) and societal attitudes that they should cede the space (Societal Critique), which reflects a ""Not in my Backyard"" perspective.

Reasoning: The comment expresses the strong opinion that homelessness is a ""them"" problem, not a societal one. It makes claims about crime rates and the housing market to support this view. It critiques what it perceives as a ""weird shift in attitude"" in society toward the issue. The speaker proposes institutionalization as a solution. The comment is based on the harmful generalization that the local homeless population consists entirely of criminals and the mentally ill, explicitly dismissing the possibility of them being ""down on their luck."" This creates a clear deserving/undeserving dichotomy. The focus on crime and trespassing also reflects a ""not in my backyard"" sentiment. The comment is classified as racist due to its use of ""refugees from far-flung countries"" as a rhetorical device to denigrate the local homeless population, a tactic that leverages implicit bias by pitting one marginalized group against another."
">Trespassing is a crime… unauthorized camping is a crime

“The law, in its majestic equality, forbids both rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges”

The sex offender problem is sort of tied up in the rest of this. We (rightly) do not want people who prey on children living close to where children congregate- but then we don’t have anywhere else for those people to go. They wind up homeless, no fixed address, and then if they do reoffend it’s harder to find them.

There should be a monitored halfway house for those kinds of offenders- but that’s a small number of the total unhoused population.

Reasoning: The commenter provides facts/claims (""Trespassing is a crime""), observations and opinions about the link between sex offender laws and homelessness, and asks a rhetorical question about housing affordability. The comment critiques government laws, societal approaches to offenders, and the inadequacy of financial solutions. It proposes a specific intervention (""monitored halfway house"").

The comment includes a subtle critique of the societal definition of homelessness and the governmental application process.

This is a harmful generalization that implicitly frames PEH as undeserving of the space they occupy.

Reasoning: The user expresses the opinion that relocating people experiencing homelessness is not a true solution. They use a rhetorical question to make their point and make the claim that this practice disincentivizes cities from spending money to solve the root problems.

Reasoning: The commenter justifies the cleanup of homeless encampments by providing observations about abandoned camps and claiming they are full of waste. They use rhetorical questions (""what else are we supposed to do?"") to express their opinion and justify the action. The statement ""That will never happen"" is a harmful generalization about the behavior of homeless individuals. The focus on cleaning ""our waterways and public areas"" has elements of NIMBYism, and the justification implies a judgment about the unhoused population.

Reasoning: The commenter uses rhetorical questions (""How exactly does raising taxes help homeless people?"") to express their opinion against increased public spending and to critique the government's effectiveness with funds. They make a claim (""There are plenty of resources already available"") and a personal observation to support a harmful generalization that homeless individuals are simply unwilling to access available help. This implies a judgment about who is ""deserving"" of aid based on their perceived effort. The comment contains no racial bias."

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by arguing against a specific intervention (creating a designated area), using rhetorical questions (""what do you do when that [STREET] is full?"") and making claims about the negative economic consequences (""businesses will leave, money and tax dollars with it""). This functions as a critique of a potential government policy and its allocation of resources (land/space). The statement reflects a ""Not in my Backyard"" (NIMBY) sentiment by arguing against visible homelessness near businesses and makes a harmful generalization by suggesting that any such designated area will inevitably become an uncontrollable problem.

Reasoning: The commenter asks a rhetorical question to challenge a traffic policy, which is a critique of government action. They then express their opinion that they would be more accepting of the policy if public transit were not, in their observation, unpleasantly shared with homeless individuals. This reflects a negative personal interaction (or perceived interaction) and creates a harmful generalization by framing the presence of homeless people as a universal, negative experience on public buses.

This observation is presented as a factual claim. The critique centers on money allocation, as they resent paying for a bus service that a PEH uses for free.

yes we would need to close down the resources so our area is no longer posted online as a ""good [STREET] for homless / good [STREET] to be homeless / easy to be homeless"" on some online forums.

"There were **two competing housing resolutions** that were introduced to [ORGANIZATION] [TIME].

1. One was crafted by citizens through grass-roots groups like ORG1, ORG2, others) and asked for a Housing Crisis be declared, a committee/task force formed, and a city staff member hired to focus on solutions.
2. The other was sponsored by five [ORGANIZATION] members and proposed no action, but made a declaration of efforts they've taken to address housing. PERSON0 led this one and the FOIA'd e-mails made him seem offended that other's hard work was going unnoticed.

Read more here: [[URL]

What I think was strange about [PERSON]'s version was that it over-emphasized the [ORGANIZATION]'s efforts on housing insecurity and homelessness. Those are important things that align with my personal values, but that's not what we're talking about. We need to increase housing supply and expedite its production so that people just have options of places to live. I believe we're making steady progress doing this like removing commercial parking requirements, creating pre-approved design plans for infill developments downtown, FAC0 improvement plan...but there are some critical approaches we have not addressed. They are local actions that impact housing supply and local prices:

* **Hire another planner or two** to work with landowners to rezone more properties to allow housing in more places (e.g. FAC0 improvement project that's underway or our [ORGANIZATION] in our [ORGANIZATION] Plan 2040 our city refuses to act on). 
* You know those brownstones in [ORGANIZATION]? Triple-deckers in [PERSON]? They are illegal to build in most of our city due to zoning. **Reform our development code.** I believe it's a problem that it's easier to build sprawling subdivisions, and harder to build compact and traditional living. We need to change the code from [ORGANIZATION] zoning to form-based zoning. [PERSON] and [PERSON] are addressing this with a world-renowned consultant right now. If [PERSON] chooses to fall behind those two cities in urban planning, it will be laughable. 
* **Reduce/reform parking minimums** for residential (maybe using overlay districts) and simultaneously invest in transit. [PERSON] is offering cities in [PERSON] a match for transit investment (design of bus stops) and the [ORGANIZATION] has not taken them up on it. 
* [ORGANIZATION] councilmembers: **Stop holding rezone requests hostage.** 

Personally, I'm mostly annoyed that it seems several councilmembers don't recognize that [PERSON] **has made great progress** ***and*** **can do more.** There IS work to be done ...do they see that? I'm concerned that they know, they just don't want it.

Reasoning: The commenter uses personal observations of littering and people on their property to form a broader opinion that compassion is a failed intervention (""we actually make it worst""). They ask rhetorical questions (""Why should the quality of life for taxpayers suffer..."") to make a point, not to seek an answer. The comment is a societal critique of compassionate approaches to homelessness. It strongly reflects a ""not in my backyard"" perspective, focusing on the negative impact on their personal property.

They support this with an observation of a relative whose supportive opinion changed after a negative personal interaction, which is a clear example of the ""Not in my Backyard"" phenomenon. This story functions as a societal critique of performative compassion and relies on a harmful generalization by using one negative encounter with a ""trespasser"" to represent all interactions with PEH.

"I’m curious, what exactly did you do to help before? I ask because, as someone formerly homeless I literally had maybe a handful of people who actually offered any kind of material help and usually it really wasn’t much.

In fact, when I was denied [ORGANIZATION] benefits for the second time because I was foolish enough to mention during the phone interview, after all the paperwork I completed and having to wait [ORGANIZATION] for the opportunity to get  1 phone call I better not miss or have to start all over, that I mentioned I sometimes would prepare and have meals with my girlfriend. And I was denied because I refused to do as they ask and go to this woman, one of the few people who actually stood by me and saw me get out of that situation, my real guardian angel, that I felt it was inappropriate for me to then have to ask her for her [ORGANIZATION], every detail of her personal finances, ask for her college transcript, take all this very detailed personal information making her vulnerable to whoever had it and turn it over to the county and state just so I could get a couple hundred a month I could use and only use making sure I, at the very least, had food in my stomach.

When I was a homeless man, asking one of the very few programs that offer any kind of help or relief just for the help of food was denied that help. And to have that be the second time of paperwork and waiting and phone interviews and then waiting some more just to find out that our system denied a working homeless person who because of pride had put off even asking for help until I realized why not her help if it’s there. That’s when I realized it actually wasn’t there.

People talk a lot about “all the things the homeless get” and as you said yourself they’re “freeloaders” without realizing that in fact most get little to anything and the ones who do get something’s had to and have to continually fight and work to keep getting anything. All while living in a constant state of stress and trauma.

The fact is, and this is a fact you can look at the numbers yourself, we spend [STREET] more money on the bureaucracy we require to deny people help than we spend on the help that we go to great lengths to make it as difficult and shameful as we possibly can make it to get. 

That woman who had that [TIME] long phone interview with me, who I’m sure is a good and kind person trying to survive like the rest of us, that woman was getting payed. And as an employee of the city and county of [ORGANIZATION] was likely making near 6 figures if not in fact 6 figures. And we as a society payed her that sum on [LOCATION] to find a reason to deny a homeless person, sober, working and struggling, we denied a homeless person food.

So, when you say you used to do what you could to help people, besides the tax dollars that are spent “helping” in the [STREET] I described above, what exactly was that help? You’d occasionally give some coins to someone to leave you alone? You’d occasionally decide not to call the police on someone who other than being unsightly was causing no other real harm or disturbance.

Because call me crazy, but I’m maybe a little suspicious of the guy saying he’d happily look the other [STREET] if the city decided to “crack some heads”  that maybe just maybe you in fact have never really been much help to the people you’re here advocating state violence against so casually and brazenly.

Something tells me you likely would do more for a stray dog then to address in any helpful or constructive [STREET] the human misery we all have to see everyday and that pieces of shit who sound an awful lot like you do do everything in their power to undermine and put requirements on which end up increasing the costs to all of our tax dollars, not just you but all the people who actually give a damn about other human beings want actually spent on just helping people the fuck out when they’re in a tight spot.

Don’t bother with any of the usual “I’m glad to hear your doing better” or any of that crap because i already know what you think about me because of it and i guarantee you I know who you think is to blame for me being in that circumstance and I’m tired of hearing fake niceties by people who are so morally bankrupt that i already know that the time I took here to ask a basic fucking question and safeguard it from the usual bad faith horseshit that’s always employed to side step these things is almost for sure just a waste of my fucking time and effort because your not gonna hear a god damn word of what I have to say. Or you’ll call me a liar maybe or find some other bad faith misdirect or just simply resort to ad hominem or some other logical fallacy bullshit to muddy my points and force me to waste even more time debating someone who doesn’t actually have any intention of fixing anything or helping anyone and would rather see  “heads cracking”.

Cause that’s how you solve your problems in life.

Reasoning: The commenter's post is a complex mix of communication styles. They begin by asking a genuine question but frame their entire narrative with rhetorical questions, strong opinions, and observations from their personal experience with homelessness. The core of their argument is a multi-layered critique of how aid money is allocated to bureaucracy instead of people (Money Aid Allocation), the government systems that create these barriers (Government Critique), and the societal attitudes that view the homeless as ""freeloaders"" (Societal Critique).

Reasoning: The commenter provides a personal observation of their neighborhood, expressing a strong negative opinion about the situation. It critiques police inaction (""Government Critique"") and what it perceives as an overly permissive or ""out of touch"" societal attitude (""Societal Critique""). The final sentence is a sarcastic, rhetorical question.

This is a harmful generalization about a specific ethnic group and panhandlers in general. Based on this, they express an opinion that people should not give money directly to panhandlers (a critique of money allocation) and instead donate to services (a proposed solution).

Reasoning: The commenter expresses a strong negative opinion about the user they are replying to (""radical,"" ""sad bubble,"" ""slacktavism""). They provide claims about their own actions (""donated more,"" ""voted for more"") to position themselves as more genuinely helpful. They express the opinions of others by stating ""Most [ORGANIZATION] feels the same [STREET] as I do,"" which suggests a localized ""not in my backyard"" sentiment shared by a community group regarding a specific street or area.

Perception Type: [harmful generalization]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter uses a factual claim (the number of homeless people) and a simple calculation to implicitly express an opinion criticizing the efficiency of spending. This is a critique of money aid allocation and, by extension, the government or organization responsible for the funds. The oversimplified calculation promotes a harmful generalization by ignoring the complexities and overhead costs of homeless services, suggesting the problem should be easily solved with the available funds. The comment does not contain any racial bias."

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion (""I think..."") on how cities should handle homelessness and makes a claim about cities lacking resources. This functions as a critique of government capacity and resource allocation. They propose a specific intervention (""sweeps of large problem camps""). The comment creates a harmful generalization by labeling a group as ""service resistant"" and implicitly frames them as less deserving of voluntary engagement, thus justifying forceful measures. The comment does not contain any racial bias."

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by proposing a multi-step solution to the housing crisis, which directly relates to homelessness. This solution involves raising taxes (money aid allocation) and government-funded housing (government critique), and it critiques the societal structure where wealth inequality and profit motives limit housing access (societal critique).

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on how different issues related to homelessness should be handled, making the factual claim that poverty is not a crime. They critique a ""corrupt police union"" and its policies, which falls under government critique. They also propose specific solutions or interventions (prison for crime, mental hospitals for mental illness). The comment categorizes people to determine the appropriate response (e.g., criminals deserve prison, the mentally ill deserve hospitalization), which fits the deserving/undeserving perception type.

Reasoning: The commenter uses rhetorical questions to challenge the idea that homeless people are 100% at fault for their situation, thereby expressing their opinion. By contrasting homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] with other developed nations, the comment implicitly critiques the government and societal structures that allow for such a disparity. This challenges the ""deserving/undeserving"" narrative by shifting focus from individual blame to systemic issues. The comment does not contain any racial bias."

Reasoning: The commenter uses sarcasm to express a negative opinion about people experiencing homelessness (PEH) and the organizations that provide aid. They reference an idea from others (""the idea that the mess... resulted from [ORGANIZATION]""), make a personal observation about trash near their home, and use this to make a harmful generalization that PEH steal property and litter. This expresses a ""not in my backyard"" sentiment and implies that the individuals are undeserving of the aid they receive due to their behavior. The critique is aimed at both the aid organization's methods and broader societal tolerance for the perceived negative behaviors."

The comment proposes ""public intervention"" as a necessary solution. It does not contain any personal perceptions or racial bias."
"I'm from [ORGANIZATION] and I have to say there is really a huge disparity between homelessness on [ORGANIZATION] vs [LOCATION], particularly concerning the behaviors of these communities.

I understand all of the facets that make GPE2 so attractive to those that are struggling with homelessness — mild climate, generous citizens, enabling government — but to compare the homeless communities of the LOC2 to those of the east is like comparing apples to oranges.

This forms a societal critique about the perceived causes of homelessness and suggests that interventions should differ based on the cause.

">""increased law enforcement"" implies people want more cops.

>Actual responses in the article suggest people want increased enforcement of laws.

How has this become the takeaway for people from this article? It's hardly the main point.

First of all, we need both - the cops we have need to do a better job of enforcing the laws, and we need more cops to cover more areas, more consistently, and to make sure there is sufficient availability for them to respond whenever a call for assistance comes in, even if it's not an immediate emergency. 

But the real issue here is something else entirely - that by a clear majority, people in this city are sick and tired of people simply being allowed to do whatever they want, wherever they want, without consequence. Not because they're not compassionate, not because they don't understand that many people who are homeless truly got there through no fault of their own or that most of us could relatively easily end up in the same situation, but because they realize that for those that struggle the most to make responsible choices, an overall approach that prioritizes permissiveness and enabling is the worst possible ""solution"" - for them and for the rest of us.

Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter expresses strong opinions on how to handle homelessness, particularly when related to substance use. They propose multiple solutions, such as forced inpatient treatment, universal healthcare, and an ID system for alcohol, which function as critiques of current government policy, societal norms, and resource allocation. The proposal for an ID system creates a clear deserving/undeserving dichotomy for who can purchase alcohol. The call for ""forcible"" treatment for all drug addicts is a harmful generalization that removes individual agency. The comment does not contain any racial bias."
"[ORGANIZATION] has been housing homeless people in hotels throughout the pandemic. This program has been extended through [ORGANIZATION] and will probably be extended through [LOCATION].

 [[ORGANIZATION] will keep homeless in hotels through [ORGANIZATION], but hasn’t tapped federal money set aside to pay for [ORGANIZATION][URL]

>[ORGANIZATION] will continue housing about 500 homeless residents in hotel rooms at least through [ORGANIZATION], extending a program designed to prevent the spread of [ORGANIZATION], even though it has not yet applied for $35 million in federal money that would pay for it. 

These hotels are probably not 5 star rated and the view may not be as nice as the [PERSON] waterfront. However, it would seem to be much better than living in a tent long term. The hotels not only provide shelter and safety, but electricity, running water, bathrooms, heat, A/C, change of towels and bed linen and probably cable TV. 

It seems that there is a short term solution already in [STREET] for the few tents that have sprung up in [PERSON] as well as longer term solutions that are being planned.

They express their opinion that this is a better alternative to tents and observe the amenities hotels offer. The comment includes a government critique by highlighting a report that the organization has not tapped into available federal money for the program, which is a critique of money aid allocation. The entire comment is focused on the hotel program as a solution/intervention and is based on information from media portrayals rather than personal experience. The comment contains no racial bias."

Then you have to factor in being somewhere dry and thankfully it doesn't seem that homeless people aren't being harassed here but you still have some pretty rough conditions.

Reasoning: The commenter uses a rhetorical question to express their opinion and frustration about high property taxes in relation to spending on homelessness. They make a claim that the city's plan is a corrupt scheme for officials and developers, which is a direct critique of the government and its allocation of financial resources. They sarcastically propose a solution (tax relief for themselves) to make their point. The comment does not contain stereotypes about PEH or any racial bias."

Reasoning: The commenter asks both a genuine question (""Is this guy causing any problems..."") and a rhetorical one (""Why not try talking to him."") to make a point. They express their opinion that the homeless person is likely harmless, contrasting this with other perceived dangers, which is a form of societal critique.

Reasoning: The comment provides specific, actionable advice on how to engage with city services and community organizations to help an individual, which qualifies as a solution/intervention. It also expresses an opinion on the best course of action and makes a claim about the slowness of the process, which is an implicit critique of the governmental/organizational system. The comment is procedural and does not express a personal perception of the individual experiencing homelessness or contain any racial bias."
"I'm glad you're able to speak about it in the past tense, but whether it's ever true isn't really the point. It's that of all the reasons an unhoused person may not be in a shelter (for instance, access or safety), it's the emphasis on the one that's that person's fault.

Reasoning: The user describes their personal behavior (observation) and expresses a preference for donating to charities rather than directly to panhandlers (opinion). This is a form of personal money aid allocation and is presented as their chosen solution.

Reasoning: The commenter is responding to another user, asking genuine questions to understand their logic (""I'm not sure why you're asking me..."") and a rhetorical question to pivot the conversation (""But the squeegee issue?""). They express the opinion that homelessness is a more pressing issue than ""squeegee boys"" and claim the mayor is focused on it. This represents a societal critique of what issues get prioritized. By differentiating between ""people begging"" and ""squeegee boys"" and arguing one is a more ""pressing matter,"" the commenter makes a judgment about which group's issues are more deserving of attention.

Critique Category: [government critique]

racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter uses rhetorical questions (""So what if the people don't want...?"", ""How do you keep people off the benches...?"") to express an opinion on the difficulty of addressing homelessness, particularly for those who may be service-resistant. This framing invokes a harmful generalization about PEH not wanting to work or be housed, which touches on the deserving/undeserving narrative. The comment discusses interventions like soup kitchens and the church's role as a sanctuary. It also includes a subtle government critique by contrasting the church's long history of providing aid with the shorter tenure of governments. The comment does not contain any racial bias."

Perception Type: [not in my backyard, harmful generalization]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by proposing a hostile intervention designed to keep people experiencing homelessness (PEH) away from their personal property. This is a clear example of a ""Not in my Backyard"" (NIMBY) sentiment and a ""Harmful Generalization,"" as it dehumanizes PEH by treating them as pests to be deterred. The suggestion itself is a form of ""Solutions/Interventions,"" albeit a cruel one. It can be interpreted as an implicit ""Societal Critique,"" suggesting society has failed to address the issue, forcing individuals to take matters into their own hands. The bias is based on housing status, not race."

"It took no effort.  There are literally dozens of them. It's like our society is built to support and maintain a homeless population.

They propose a market-based solution: encouraging development everywhere to eventually revitalize blighted areas. The comment does not critique government or society but rather discusses development principles.

Mayor's Statement

> GPE1, [PERSON]. -- Like everyone in our city, state and across this nation, we mourned the senseless killing of [PERSON]. To now learn that family members staged this brutal killing is beyond belief and represents a double tragedy. They were responsible for taking [ORGANIZATION]'s life with unconscionable cruelty, and contrived to do so in our city under the guise of random violence, exploiting the legitimate fears of our residents. I commend our homicide detectives for their expert and tireless work in bringing those truly responsible to justice in this very troubling and sad case.

Perception Type: [media portrayal, harmful generalization]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The text is a mayor's statement, not a Reddit comment. It provides facts about a murder case where the victim's family attempted to blame a homeless person. It expresses the mayor's opinion on the ""unconscionable cruelty"" and references the public's shared grief. The statement offers a societal critique by noting the perpetrators ""exploit[ed] the legitimate fears of our residents,"" pointing to a societal problem. This connects to Perception Type, as the statement is a piece of media about a media-covered event and directly addresses how the criminals leveraged a harmful generalization (that a homeless person is a likely suspect for a violent crime) to create a cover story. The statement contains no racial bias."

Perception Type: [not in my backyard]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter expresses their strong opinion by quoting and reacting to another person's sentiment. The critique is aimed at the societal attitude of prioritizing personal aesthetics over the need for affordable housing, which is a clear example of a ""Not in my Backyard"" (NIMBY) perception. By stating we should value affordable housing over a condo view, the commenter is advocating for a solution. The comment contains no racial bias."
"I have recently moved back to [ORGANIZATION] after [ORGANIZATION] of living out of state. I am shocked at the number of pan handlers and how risky the behavior is in the various median strips and at stop lights. This is a horrible indicator of the state of [ORGANIZATION] that includes the ripped up roads and the lack of leadership. Panhandling should absolutely be regulated for public safety.

Reasoning: The commenter shares their personal observation of an increase in panhandling since moving back to the area. They express the opinion that this indicates a ""lack of leadership"" (government critique) and that panhandling should be regulated. They provide a potential solution by citing another city's system of discouraging direct giving in favor of text-based donations (solutions/interventions, money aid allocation). The comment is based on their direct, though not one-on-one, experiences seeing panhandlers (personal interaction). The comment contains no explicit or implicit racial bias."
"I regularly see panhandlers in the parking lots of shopping centers in [ORGANIZATION].

"Yup, and just thinking back to when me and an ex moved from a smallish one-bedroom to a rowhouse for the first time and all the shit that entailed.

They propose a specific intervention: a stepped housing plan starting with Single Room Occupancy (SROs). The comment does not contain any critique, specific perception types, or racial bias."
"> just saw a cop chilling there

Critique Category: [money aid allocation, government critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: None
racist: No
Reasoning: The user expresses an opinion, framed as a financial claim, that directly paying panhandlers would be a more cost-effective solution than paying for police enforcement. This critiques the government's allocation of resources. The comment uses a rhetorical question to emphasize the futility of policing such a widespread issue and proposes a specific intervention. It does not rely on stereotypes or racial bias."

Perception Type: [personal interaction]

Reasoning: The commenter expresses a personal thought (""I often wonder"") based on their observation of a common scenario at traffic lights. This highlights a specific dynamic of personal interaction between drivers and people experiencing homelessness, which can be seen as a subtle critique of how society navigates these encounters. The comment does not contain any racial bias or propose solutions."
"I really appreciate your car and concern for your homeless neighbors. However It’s not your job to solve an individuals problems that they aren’t asking to be solved. If they are asking for money or food, give them that. Trying to solve an individuals problems that they haven’t asked for is condescending and smacks of saviorism. 

If you want to help deal with the structural issues that lead to homelessness then do that on a systemic level. Advocate for increased spending on mental health, [ORGANIZATION], addiction resources. Fight against things that increase homelessness like non violent drug law sentencing, loitering laws, etc. 

There are some good advocacy organizations in [ORGANIZATION] that can guide you and help you figure out how to plug in.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses a strong opinion on the appropriate way to help, contrasting direct individual intervention with systemic action. They make the claim that unsolicited help is ""condescending."" The comment critiques societal attitudes (""saviorism""), government policies (drug sentencing, loitering laws), and the allocation of money for services (mental health, addiction). The entire second half is dedicated to proposing solutions and interventions, including specific advocacy organizations.

racist: [No]
Reasoning: The comment provides a factual claim about an organization placing people in hotels and suggests this as a potential solution or intervention. This action inherently relates to how money and aid are allocated. The comment is a neutral suggestion and does not express an opinion, critique, or contain any harmful perceptions or racial bias."

Critique Category: [money aid allocation]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The comment makes a broad claim about the abundance of services and expresses an opinion that this should be sufficient for anyone. This is a harmful generalization that ignores the complex barriers PEH face (e.g., mental health, bureaucracy, lack of documents) and implicitly judges those who remain unhoused as undeserving or personally at fault. The comment touches upon the topic of aid allocation by claiming resources are plentiful. No racial bias is present."
"[ORGANIZATION] isn't as cheap for housing as people say. Apparently they haven't rented an apartment or room in [ORGANIZATION] or FAC0 in awhile. If they did they would know at those prices you usually only get a craphole.

Jobs here are great if you know people, if you social network you can make money in this town. If you are secluded and keep to yourself chances are you will only make min wage or just above.

There is a huge income disparity in ORGANIZATION.
I have found myself homeless here twice in [ORGANIZATION]. 

Once because of a job that closed (FAC1). Another time because I rented one of those *reasonably* priced apartments and dealt with a crazy landlord who would often come into my apartment. Sometimes when I was home, others when I was not home. That's just the start of it.

(Disclaimer: Being white and educated doesn't mean you aren't poor, a lot of people are educated here and job competition is vicious.)
I am white.
I have a DATE1 degree.
I do smoke pot, so that has definitely been a huge obstacle for me to overcome in regards to professional jobs.
But other than that I do not drink, take pills or other drugs.

So other than that, [ORGANIZATION] can be a great city to live in.
But the downsides are the nepotism, cold, income disparity, high rental prices, lack of reasonable bus system(that arrives on time or to the suburbs), [ORGANIZATION] collar/non-union).

Oh, and if you have any issues with credit good luck renting anywhere corporate. I was a unlucky individual with a awesome mother who used my info for utilities and other bills that makes renting that [STREET] near impossible. 

I'm not knocking [ORGANIZATION], but it has some serious issues and I just wanted to offer an alternative perspective from my lifelong episode of poverty and snow.

Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [personal interaction]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter shares their personal experiences (""I have found myself homeless here twice"") with housing instability and poverty in a specific location. They provide claims about high rent and income disparity, critique societal issues like nepotism and corporate renting practices, and offer a critique of the public bus system (government critique). They also provide advice, which serves as a personal-level solution (e.g., ""try to avoid temp agencies""). The comment is based entirely on personal interaction and contains no racial bias; in fact, it attempts to counter stereotypes by stating that a white, educated person can also experience poverty."

Critique Category: []
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: No
Reasoning: The speaker is expressing their opinion as a claim about the motivations of a small percentage of people experiencing homelessness. By framing some as ""looking for easy money"" and putting ""homeless"" in quotes, it creates a deserving/undeserving dichotomy and makes a generalization about the intentions of a subgroup. The comment does not contain any racial bias."

Critique Category: [money aid allocation, government critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: []
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The comment uses a rhetorical structure (""Things that make you go hmmmm"") to express an opinion and critique the cost efficiency of non-profits building affordable housing versus private developers. This is a critique of money aid allocation and, by extension, the government systems that fund such projects. It also provides a specific observation on the housing designs. The comment does not contain any racist language or stereotypes about people experiencing homelessness."
"This is a good point. I'm not sure if you're using this as an argument that people WANT segregation, or if you're just pointing out something you've seen, but the idea of gentrification brings attention to how out-of-balance things are. 

Gentrification is fucking awesome to people who own property, right? Like - if I bought a home for $40k and suddenly that neighborhood became the [STREET] to be, I'd be pumped to earn over 1000% on my investment over [ORGANIZATION]. 

But let's face it: **Gentrification is happening in places where the people living there do NOT own property.** They're tenants renting someone else's property. The ""kind"" landlords will raise rent to merely catch up with tax assessments and basic inflation, the rest of them will go ""the market value has changed"" (I put ""kind"" in quotes because very, very, very few landlords are anything but exploitative). 

***

So when we look at answering questions about systemic racism and living/property costs and wealth, a few things come up:

- Generational wealth is a concept that has positively impacted whites at a higher rate than [ORGANIZATION]. Everything from slavery to [ORGANIZATION] to redlining so every other flavor of systemic racism, the privilege of building and passing on generational wealth isn't afforded to many [ORGANIZATION]. Escaping the poverty loop is hard enough - and when you don't have generational wealth to build/pass on, you're stuck renting and hoping you don't get gentrified out of your living situation.
 - With no generational wealth, you greatly reduce the likelihood that the affected person can purchase a home
 - YES - white people deal with this too, albeit on a less-proportional level, and without the many other roadblocks. It needs to be understood that certain measures that may benefit [ORGANIZATION] may benefit whites in this same position...
- Accessibility to homes for those who might actually be in a position to purchase is waning. If you're [ORGANIZATION] from the east side and you want to remain in the community you grew up in, you might be looking at the east side. You might find something that's within your price range. You might also learn that your home's value may not appreciate faster than the rate of inflation because of where you are.
 - ""Crime!"" some of the neolibs and conservatives will cry. ""It's that [STREET] because of crime! Fix the crime and values will go up!"" Perhaps - but tell me how much that value actually goes up when the sounds of the 33 drown out your backyard [ORGANIZATION].
 - Hidden barriers. Aside from the pseudo-redlining that still happens among [ORGANIZATION], those $40,000 homes on the east side often require additional money to make them comfortably habitable. 
- NIMBY will always be a huge roadblock. Every time anyone ever mentions ""affordable housing"" - whether it's an income-based apartment complex or some allocation for some affordable path to home ownership, people make a stink. They will fight for ""those people"" to go back to to the [STREET] they belong and then use every dog whistle, holier-than-thou argument, and sob story about how the safety of their neighborhood is at risk.",buffalo,"Comment Type: [ask a rhetorical question, provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions]

Reasoning: The comment provides a complex analysis of the socioeconomic factors leading to housing instability, framing it as a critique of systemic issues like gentrification, redlining (government critique), and societal attitudes (societal critique). It expresses strong opinions on these topics, uses rhetorical questions to make points, and describes the opinions of others (e.g., ""neolibs and conservatives""). The comment discusses potential solutions like ""affordable housing"" and explicitly critiques the ""Not in my Backyard"" (NIMBY) mentality and the ""deserving/undeserving"" judgments often used by its proponents. The comment is explicitly anti-racist, identifying systemic racism as a root cause of the issues discussed."

racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion (""I think"") based on a personal observation (""the [STREET] I see it"") about an individual's motives. By distinguishing between the person's perceived desire for a free private stay versus an institutional one, it implies a judgment about the person's intentions and the type of help they are willing to accept, which falls into the deserving/undeserving framework. There is no racial bias in the comment."

They make a direct claim that the individual is not homeless and lives in a specific type of housing (Provide a Fact or Claim). They also express the opinion that the person ""chooses the attempted drifter life,"" which is a judgment on the person's motivations and character, fitting the Deserving/Undeserving perception type. The comment does not contain any broader critiques, proposed solutions, or racial bias."
"The issue isn’t that the use of demolition: it was the indiscriminate use of demolition without consideration or alternative or long term plan, and worse, that it continued even as [ORGANIZATION] began its “renaissance” and through to [ORGANIZATION]. A sound policy in [LOCATION] when the city is reeling and losing thousands of people [ORGANIZATION] doesn’t make sense in [LOCATION] let alone [PERSON] when there’s a need for more affordable housing, and houses, any house, sell for thousands and thousands at the in-rem auction. 

Again, do I blame them for using sound public policy for DATE5 city planning? No, but the lack of follow up and no transition to an alternative policy as [ORGANIZATION] (in particular it’s real estate market) improve is just so frustrating. The result has been hyper increases in valuation and gentrification in some neighborhoods and intensifying concentration of poverty in others, and allowing developers to tear down huge swaths of [ORGANIZATION] (as some folks above seem to be salivating for) won’t change that: leadership and effective public policy will.",buffalo,"Comment Type: [ask a rhetorical question, provide a fact or claim, express their opinion, express others opinions]

Reasoning: The commenter critiques government housing policy (demolition) and its failure to adapt over time, which they claim has led to gentrification and concentrated poverty. They express their own opinion and frustration, reference the opinions of others (""as some folks above seem to be salivating for""), use a rhetorical question to frame their point, and propose ""leadership and effective public policy"" as the solution. The comment contains no stereotypes or personal interactions with PEH, nor any racist language."
"Overall agree, but ""affordable housing"" just means subsidizing housing for a small group of people at the cost of increased housing costs for everyone else, among the other bad things that come with specific subsidized housing.

Reasoning: The commenter provides a claim about the economic effects of ""affordable housing"" and expresses their opinion that this specific policy is a poor solution. This functions as a critique of government-led interventions and how financial aid for housing is allocated. The comment focuses on policy mechanics rather than perceptions of homeless people and contains no racial bias."
"DATE0 has almost 0 relevance to this conversation; cost of living is astronomically higher, while real wages have been stagnant for most of DATE1 DATE2. The housing crisis is an *affordability* crisis, and increasing supply across the board is a strategy to solve it.

Not everywhere needs to have middle density housing options, but you also don't want to completely suburbanize parts of [ORGANIZATION] with single-family homes, especially when it means higher utility costs and greenhouse gas emissions per capita. 

I'd also push back on the idea there was no housing crisis in [LOCATION], since urban renewal efforts targeting ""overcrowded"" black neighborhoods began soon after WWII, as black renters were not allowed in many ""higher end"" (white) neighborhoods. So an actually colorblind housing market might have seen higher demand for density outside of downtown if black urbanites could choose where they were able to build their lives.",buffalo,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, express their opinion]

Reasoning: The user provides facts and claims about stagnant wages and historical housing discrimination (""urban renewal efforts targeting 'overcrowded' black neighborhoods""). They express their opinion that the housing crisis is an affordability crisis solvable by increasing supply and promoting middle-density housing. This constitutes a critique of government housing policy and historical societal racism. The comment proposes a specific solution (increasing housing supply) and is not racist; rather, it critiques historical racism."
"There has been a shift in language to calling these individuals unhoused versus homeless. A home doesn’t have to be a stable structure, it can be a specific city or even a feeling…one can find a sense of home with people, on the open [STREET], etc. and some unhoused people are offended by the implication that they have no home when they’re referred to as homeless. “Unhoused,” on the other hand, indicates the person doesn’t have a physical residence at which they reside - a literal structure.

This is not as flashy or righteous as giving it to LGBTQ homeless people. The best outcome is someone pops a tent on the sidewalk, neighbors and local businesses call police immediately because encampments are not normalized here, and the tent is thrown in the trash. Worst outcome is someone pops the tent on private property and they are verbally/physically threatened before their tent is thrown away.

You can empathize with the homeless and gladly pay taxes to support people. You don't have to allow encampments to spring up in public places. You let that fester long enough under good intentions and you turn into [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON]. Look up the [ORGANIZATION] long skirmishes between police and activists over clearing encampments in FAC0 in [PERSON].

[ORGANIZATION] isn't a wealthy or glamorous city, but people value nice, safe public spaces.

Perception Type: [not in my backyard, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter expresses a strong opinion, arguing that while they support social programs, they are against the creation of public encampments. This embodies the ""Not in my Backyard"" perspective. They critique a specific aid strategy (giving out tents directly) and propose an alternative (giving them to a nonprofit), which falls under ""Money Aid Allocation"" critique and ""Solutions/Interventions"". The comment also includes a ""Societal Critique"" of ""good intentions"" leading to negative outcomes and a ""Government Critique"" by referencing failures in other cities. The prediction that encampments will be pushed to ""the worst parts of town"" implies a ""Deserving/Undeserving"" spatial hierarchy. The comment does not contain any racial bias."

racist: [No]
Reasoning: The user provides a claim about a ""homeless bus"" service and supports it with a personal observation about the environment (a decrease in a specific smell). This observation implicitly critiques the effectiveness or nature of the ""bus out"" program, which is a type of government or organizational intervention. The comment relies on a harmful generalization by associating the entire group of people being bussed away with the ""urine smell."" No racial bias is present in the text."
"There was no discussion of illegal aliens during the town hall, only of homeless people in general. PERSON0 probably would not send migrants here because it is too close to [ORGANIZATION].",elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [not in my backyard]
racist: Yes
Reasoning: The comment provides a factual claim/observation about a town hall's agenda and then expresses an opinion about a political figure's potential actions. This speculation on a politician's motives for not sending migrants to a specific area represents a subtle government critique and carries a ""not in my backyard"" (NIMBY) undertone. The use of the term ""illegal alien,"" which is widely considered a pejorative slur, introduces implicit racial bias."
Homelessness is only going to get worse.  Interest rates and housing costs are going up.  Minimum wage earners cannot afford housing anywhere in the country.

Perception Type: []
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter makes claims about economic conditions (interest rates, housing costs, minimum wage) and expresses an opinion on how the city should reallocate its funds. This is a critique of government spending priorities and broader societal economic structures. The suggestion to use money to ""help people instead"" is a proposed solution. The comment focuses on systemic issues and contains no racial bias or specific perceptions of homeless individuals."

Perception Type: [not in my backyard, harmful generalization]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The comment uses rhetorical questions (""Why would your wonderful governor complain...?"", ""No?"") to express a sarcastic opinion and critique what the author perceives as hypocrisy. The critique is aimed at the ""blue state"" government and its people for not ""welcoming"" the homeless, which is a form of societal and government critique. It accuses the residents of having a ""Not in my Backyard"" attitude and makes a harmful generalization about all people in a ""blue state."" The comment's focus is on political affiliation, with no racial bias present."
"Someone mentioned gas stations, and I second that advice.

I have several friends whi are mangers at different [ORGANIZATION] gas stations and give homeless regulars  a ""job"" which is really just taking out the garbage and keeping the outside of the store clean in exchange for hot food that they are going to toss anyway, and even water and coffee. As long as they don't scare the customers away by hanging out/sleeping/begging on the premises, it works out well.

One of them had a woman who was outside of his store for [ORGANIZATION], rain or shine, in heat or cold. Her son was in prison, and she was trying to raise money to get an apartment for herself and him so that he would have a [STREET] to go when he got out. She was very friendly and never asked anyone for money outright - just would give a friendly ""hi"" and have [DATE].And if people gave her money, she would thank them, and she saved every penny - never used any on herelf so my friend let her get water/food from inside. I would stop and chat with her sometimes, that's how I know why she was out there. My friend let her stay out there all the [STREET] until she had the money to get her own [STREET]. I remember the last time I saw her, she updated me and told me she had got a [STREET] and was now trying to find some cheap furniture. I haven't seen her out there since, so  I'm glad that she made it.

My other friend who manages another [ORGANIZATION], had a guy there who he exchanged food and drinks for cleaning up the outside of the property and emptying the trash.  That worked out well for [LOCATION]. I would see this guy there all the time and it worked out well for both of them until recently -  he had to finally kick the guy out because he started bringing his friends who were  addicts and they started building a makeshift house on the side of the building and were kind of creeping the customers out.

Reasoning: The commenter shares personal observations and claims about informal arrangements between gas station managers and PEH, based on their friends' experiences and their own interactions (""I would stop and chat with her sometimes""). They propose this as a solution or intervention for others. The comment implicitly creates a deserving/undeserving framework, as help is shown to be conditional on the PEH's behavior (e.g., being friendly, not scaring customers). The comment does not critique broader systems and contains no racial bias."

racist: [No]
Reasoning: The user makes a factual claim (""Homeless don't normally panhandle"") while also referencing a common societal assumption. This acts as a societal critique. The statement is a broad generalization about both panhandlers and people experiencing homelessness. By creating a sharp distinction between the two groups, it can lead to a deserving/undeserving perception (e.g., that panhandlers are not the 'true' homeless who may need help).

Reasoning: The commenter shares a personal observation of being ""accosted"" and expresses their opinion by speculating that the person might have been homeless. This links a negative interaction to homelessness without any evidence, which is a harmful generalization. The comment does not contain any racial bias."

racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter shares personal observations and interactions, such as offering food. They make a harmful generalization by claiming that PEH from out of town have a ""bad attitude."" The statement that individuals ""are going to want to seek and want"" help creates a deserving/undeserving dichotomy, implying help is only for those who prove they want it. The comment also implicitly suggests a solution: that PEH should utilize existing resources. No racial bias is present."
"Not saying that those aren’t factors—they definitely are—but the truth is that the majority of homeless people are mentally ill, addicted to drugs, or both.

Reasoning: The user presents a statement as a fact (""the truth is that the majority..."") and also expresses their opinion (""If I had to guess...""). The comment makes a sweeping claim that the ""majority"" of PEH have mental illness or drug addiction, which is a harmful generalization that oversimplifies a complex issue and contributes to stigma. The comment does not contain any racial bias."

Perception Type: [personal interaction, harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [Yes]
Reasoning: The commenter asks a genuine question to differentiate between unhoused migrants and other homeless individuals. They then make an observation, based on personal experience, that one group (migrants) is displacing the other. This creates a harmful generalization and an implicit ""deserving/undeserving"" dynamic between two vulnerable populations. The comment is classified as racist because it contains implicit xenophobic bias, blaming a migrant group for the problems of a local homeless population and creating a divisive narrative."

Reasoning: The comment expresses an opinion in the form of a safety tip, supported by claims and observations distinguishing between ""homeless"" and ""transients."" It creates a harmful generalization by asserting that ""transients"" are often dangerous and wanted criminals. This distinction also creates an implicit hierarchy of deserving vs. undeserving by separating a supposedly ""legitimate"" homeless person from a dangerous ""transient,"" thereby making a judgment about who is a threat.

Reasoning: The comment makes a specific claim about which organization distributes food stamps to people experiencing homelessness. This is a statement of fact (as the user understands it) and directly relates to the allocation of financial aid.

Reasoning: The comment provides a potential solution or intervention (checking nursing homes) based on a claim about a systemic pathway for people experiencing homelessness after hospitalization. The phrase ""assuming there is a funding source"" points to the critique category of money aid allocation, as it highlights the financial dependency of this process.

Reasoning: The commenter makes a claim that [ORGANIZATION] carries an unfair ""burden,"" which is an expression of their opinion. They use a rhetorical question to make the point that many unhoused people in the area are not originally from there. This functions as a critique of how resources are allocated and an implicit criticism of other governments for not managing their own unhoused populations. This creates a harmful generalization by framing unhoused people as a migratory burden and subtly distinguishes between a ""deserving"" local population and an ""undeserving"" population from elsewhere, which is a form of ""not in my backyard"" thinking on a larger scale.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses strong opinions about the state of their country, critiquing the government's failure to address homelessness and its financial priorities. They provide observations from personal volunteering and claim other countries have solved the problem, suggesting this as a potential solution. The comment is classified as racist due to the implicit bias in the rhetoric that pits ""our people"" against ""useless foreign countries"" and ""migrants"" in a zero-sum competition for resources, creating a nativist and hierarchical view of who is deserving of aid."

Reasoning: The user expresses their opinion by making the counter-claim that affordable housing brings crime, calling the opposing view a lie. This is a critique of the strategy used by proponents (""y'all""), often government or advocacy groups, for these projects. The comment reflects a ""Not in my Backyard"" (NIMBY) sentiment by linking affordable housing to crime and relies on the harmful generalization that such housing and its residents are inherently criminal.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by advising caution and provides a claim that many panhandlers are ""scammers.""

Reasoning: The comment provides a direct solution for someone looking to make a documentary, and the specific details about the person (""he's a good guy. He's real skinny with a bald head"") imply personal interaction. The comment is classified as racist due to the implicit bias in the final sentence. By suggesting going to a place for homeless veterans ""if you want diversity,"" it implies the non-veteran homeless population is not diverse (i.e., is racially monolithic) and tokenizes the veteran population as a means to achieve a superficial ""diversity"" for a project."

The speaker provides claims about shelter euthanasia (""800+ with euthanasias""), shares personal observations about suffering dogs, and expresses their opinion (""not liking dogs is not a good excuse"").

"The issue is infrastructure and transportation. The whole point is to be able to have affordable housing with nearby public transportation.

This is a critique of government policy and resource allocation. The phrase ""send them to be someone else's problem"" expresses a negative opinion on this practice and directly describes a ""not in my backyard"" mentality at a municipal level. The comment discusses a specific, albeit controversial, intervention. There is no racial bias present in the comment."
"Yes. Move to [ORGANIZATION]. [PERSON] is not comparable to [ORGANIZATION] in very many [STREET] other than it’s very Hispanic culture (but ep food is better), great weather (esept the wind 💨). The cost of living is rapidly on the rise though. Housing and especially affordable housing is very limited. Crime is a fraction of GPE2. It’s a great [STREET].",elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [None]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [None]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The comment provides factual claims (limited affordable housing, cost of living) and personal opinions/observations (food, weather) about a city. It proposes a solution for an individual (""Move to [ORGANIZATION]""). However, it does not offer a critique of government or society, nor does it discuss perceptions of people experiencing homelessness. The reference to ""Hispanic culture"" is a neutral descriptor of the location and does not show racial bias."
"It's a pretty well known fact that most homeless people will try to migrate to an area that is more open/accommodating to homelessness AND that their destination has good to great weather [ORGANIZATION] round. Why would homeless people stay in [ORGANIZATION], much less [PERSON] with our climate? Not surprised in the least about what this map shows.",elpaso,"Comment Type: [ask a rhetorical question, provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion]
Critique Category: N/A
Response Category: N/A
Perception Type: [harmful generalization]
racist: No
Reasoning: The user presents a claim about homeless migration as a ""well known fact,"" expresses their opinion that the map's data is unsurprising, and asks a rhetorical question to support their point. This constitutes a harmful generalization by asserting that ""most homeless people"" migrate based on weather and accommodation, a common stereotype that oversimplifies the complex and varied reasons for homelessness. The comment does not critique specific systems or offer solutions, and it contains no racial bias."

"I've been living in [ORGANIZATION] for [ORGANIZATION] and although the homeless population isn't nearly as bad as other major cities, I have noticed an increase since the pandemic. Not sure what the root cause is either. 

I speculate that a lot of homeless come from out of town and end up staying here because they noticed is so quiet and peaceful compared to say [PERSON] or GPE2.",elpaso,"Comment Type: provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion
Critique Category: None
Response Category: None
Perception Type: harmful generalization
racist: No
Reasoning: The user provides an observation about an increase in the local homeless population, which is presented as a claim. They then express their personal opinion by speculating on the cause (""I speculate that a lot of homeless come from out of town...""). This speculation is a harmful generalization, as it promotes the common stereotype that homelessness is an external issue caused by outsiders rather than a local one. The comment does not offer any critiques or solutions and contains no racial bias."
"I have not experienced 'aggression', though I do see homeless people. They often come to check out my apartment complex's dumpster in the evening, which I know because I can see from my window, and I see homeless people resting or signs of habitation underneath the bridges over train tracks and interstates and places like that.

All I can say is that you would probably be 'rude' if you were homeless too - constantly watching your back, not knowing when you'll get your next meal, having no reliable [STREET] of comfort and refuge. 

[ORGANIZATION] is pretty bad for homeless too - it can be hard to even find a bathroom as someone with no car. I've been told to walk over a mile to use the bathroom before. Being homeless would be far worse.",elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide an observation, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [personal interaction]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter shares direct, personal observations of people experiencing homelessness (PEH) from their window and their own experience with a lack of public facilities. They express an empathetic opinion, suggesting the difficult circumstances of homelessness would make anyone seem ""rude."" This also functions as a societal critique on the lack of basic amenities like public bathrooms. The comment contains no racial bias."
I live in [ORGANIZATION] but spend a lot of time in [PERSON] (son there). I love [PERSON]. I have never seen a homeless person there. I know they are there but it's not like in GPE2 or [ORGANIZATION]. Everything is so affordable in [PERSON]! People are nice. Kids can do dual language in elementary school. The restaurants are wonderful. The mountains are beautiful. It's hot in [ORGANIZATION] but I get up early for my walk and the sunrise/sunsets are gorgeous. Always happy when I am there.,elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide an observation, express their opinion, provide a fact or claim]

racist: [No]
Reasoning: The user provides their personal observation about the lack of visible homelessness in one location compared to others. They express their positive opinion about the location and make factual claims about its affordability and school system.

Yeah I once offered a homeless man a free meal. I'm an [ORGANIZATION] driver and I had a customer cancel so I had free food. He took one look at it and cursed me out and said he didn't want it.,elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide an observation]
Critique Category: []
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [personal interaction, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter is recounting a specific personal story, which qualifies as providing an observation and a personal interaction. By highlighting the rejection of a charitable offer, the comment implicitly frames the homeless individual as ungrateful, which is a form of judgment that falls into the deserving/undeserving perception type. The comment does not contain any systemic critiques, proposed solutions, or racial bias."
No homelessness? Who are you trying to kid?,elpaso,"Comment Type: [ask a rhetorical question]
Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [N/A]
Perception Type: [N/A]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The comment uses a rhetorical question, ""Who are you trying to kid?"", to express strong disbelief and challenge an implied claim that homelessness does not exist. This challenge functions as an implicit critique of the source of such a claim, which is likely a government body making a political statement or a broader societal attitude that downplays or ignores the problem. The comment does not contain elements from the other categories."
