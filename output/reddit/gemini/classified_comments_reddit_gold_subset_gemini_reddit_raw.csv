Perception Type: []
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The user makes a claim about the city's actions (""dedicated half of the downtown area to homeless shelters"") and expresses a strong opinion criticizing government policy (""If the city did not want this..."") and societal approaches to charity (""narcissistically institutionalizing compassion... self congratulatory galas""), which implies a critique of how money/resources are allocated. The comment does not contain any racial bias."
"Good call [ORGANIZATION]. Many, not all, of the panhandlers don't want a job. A great deal of them are former residents of FAC0 in town. They are usually out there begging for money to pay for their addiction and put money in their dealers hand.

I believe a better option is to take any money that could have gone to this and continue to provide low cost housing for the truly homeless. Couple that with finding a [STREET] to get more mental health facilities in town would go a longer [STREET] than jobs for these people.",southbend,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion]

This creates a dichotomy between the ""truly homeless,"" who are deemed deserving of aid, and panhandlers, who are generalized as addicts not wanting to work."

"I experience the same comments with non-benders in my car. It's tough because we want [ORGANIZATION] to be better, and there's been large improvements. But there is still a [ORGANIZATION] of work to be done. At this point, I feel as if the homeless issue is starting to hold back development and other progress in the city, mainly downtown. I can't stress enough how delicate and sensitive of an issue this is for [ORGANIZATION]. Agree or not, we are a liberal city, with quite a few Democrats in charge. The bread of butter of Democrats is poor relief. Is the current situation a result of the current (local) administration/leaders? I mean, this doesn't happen overnight and is really a product of issues that effect the entire [PERSON] (is [ORGANIZATION] the only or select few with this problem? No). But here we are, with this issue in our laps. It doesn't matter so much as to how they got here. The real focus needs to be how to get them back onto their feet and self sufficient. There has been proven success with the housing first model. We don't have the capital to overnight the project and get results right away, so we are left in a holding pattern waiting for the first units to come online and gather data on how that works for us. 

I think this issue could actually be a fantastic opportunity for [ORGANIZATION] to step in. They have some of the brightest individuals there, that could use their resesrch expertise, and other knowledge to come with up with a collaborative approach with the City of [ORGANIZATION] to help tackle this problem the right [STREET]. I've always thought [ORGANIZATION] should be a little more involved with [ORGANIZATION], and I don't see why this issue would be any different. ORG2 benefits from a better [ORGANIZATION].

Reasoning: The user shares an observation about the comments others make, expresses their opinion that the issue is holding back the city, and asks a rhetorical question about the cause. The user critiques the government's role and the lack of capital (money aid allocation) for solutions. A significant portion of the comment is dedicated to discussing solutions, such as the housing-first model and a potential collaboration with a local organization. The tone is analytical and does not contain generalizations or racial bias."
"Not a big surprise?

There is not a lack of low paying jobs here. The top needs of the panhandlers is usually mental care, which we as a society really suck at providing.

"It's because you're just some [ORGANIZATION] who posted ""SB Cops Murdered a [DATE] [PERSON]"" along with a link to a local TV news story that doesn't at all support that inflammatory claim at this point.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion and makes a claim that the ""bum issue"" is caused by the services offered to homeless people, which is a critique of aid allocation.

"There are several reasons that someone couldn't stay at center for the homeless but could be at [ORGANIZATION].
Some are innocuous, such for example, [ORGANIZATION] doesn't allow pets, but [ORGANIZATION] does. [ORGANIZATION] is sex segregated so couples can't stay there together, but they can at [ORGANIZATION]. 

But the other big distinction is that [ORGANIZATION] isn't a low barrier shelter, so they have a strick drugs and alcohol policy, which [ORGANIZATION] does not. I'm pretty sure that [ORGANIZATION] also requires residents to participate in mental health and job counseling, which [ORGANIZATION] for now does not.",southbend,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim]

Reasoning: The comment provides factual claims comparing the policies of two different shelters, which are examples of different interventions or solutions.

It does not contain personal opinion or bias."
Itâs either build the center and have all of the people youâre so worried about in one [STREET] or have them out on the streets not getting the mental help they need.

"I just wanted to chime in that I think your question is so so so valid and I am glad you asked it. When you havenât been around people experiencing active homelessness and potentially untreated mental health issues it can be scary at first bc letâs be realâ¦ all the unknown things and situations in our lives are scary for the most part- positive or negative. I am relieved to see all the posts on here educating and in support of giving humans a meal, electricity, and even a space to feel safe when they barely feel safe with their own thoughts. The library is doing a beautiful thing and if it truly bothers you that much that you refuse to go to the downtown location I think you really should just be grateful you have the option and resources to [STREET] 5 miles to the next library.

Mayor [PERSON] would even go to the homeless encampments In Person and talk to those living there - even with personal persuasion, he couldnât get people to not want to live under that viaduct.

I share a lot of your concerns, but we have to remember that this needs to go *somewhere*.

We will have a vested interest in making sure the residents there succeed and receive the resources they are promised. We will also need to make sure we hold the city's feet to the fire to make sure they fulfill their promises to us and maintain our neighborhood. 

Thankfully this is a little different than a soup kitchen or shelter.

"The meeting was a great showing of varying community opinion. Went from [TIME].

\- PERSON0 got truly irate

\- PERSON1 (mayors office) got called out for unintentionally lying and providing partial information [ORGANIZATION] night to council. [TIME] before the meeting too.

\- The main guy from [ORGANIZATION] said FAC0 started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after [TIME] when there is no presence on site. Some lady from [ORGANIZATION] who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to [LOCATION] and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- [ORGANIZATION] got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until [TIME]) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- [ORGANIZATION] and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- PERSON2 of [ORGANIZATION] berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from ORG2 essentially said the same thing. [ORGANIZATION] also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes [TIME] the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which [ORGANIZATION] said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with [ORGANIZATION] apologized because they were voting against.

\- PERSON4 also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly [ORGANIZATION] employees, and people like PERSON4 who only took up [TIME] total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give [TIME] to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition [TIME]?

\- [ORGANIZATION] had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the [ORGANIZATION] project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the [STREET]. [ORGANIZATION] kept repeating they asked their consultant (DATE2) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as [ORGANIZATION] while giving numerous sites labels of [LOCATION]. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- PERSON6 tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter ([ORGANIZATION]) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""[INSTITUTION]"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. [ORGANIZATION] said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 [PERSON] meetings, 1 of which is attended. The [PERSON] barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in [ORGANIZATION] without a site in mind so then it became urgent in [LOCATION] to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around DATE4. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side?

Reasoning: The comment is a detailed observation and summary of a community meeting, recounting facts, claims, and opinions expressed by various attendees. The critiques are multi-faceted, targeting the project's cost-effectiveness (Money Aid Allocation), the actions and transparency of the council and organizations (Government Critique), and the fairness of site selection across different parts of the city (Societal Critique). It notes alternative solutions discussed (buying existing homes). The entire context is a meeting about local opposition to a proposed development, which is a clear example of a ""Not in my Backyard"" situation. The comment itself does not contain racial bias; it critiques a potentially inequitable system of site selection."

"I like some of his ideas but I have a better chance being a pro basketball player than [ORGANIZATION] does consolidating departments or initiatives with [PERSON]. Him thinking that's possible makes me question if he's just saying that to get away with the ""how will you pay for this"" question than it either shows willful misleading or not understanding the dynamic between the two cities.

He seems to be trying to be the best of both worlds and say ""hey if you like [ORGANIZATION] and where the city is going I'm your guy but also hey [ORGANIZATION] is overrated and the city needs a lot of work"" it's an interesting strategy. I think he actually has a more critical view of [ORGANIZATION] and the city government than he let's on (which there is nothing wrong with) that I wish he would just come out in the open and say so the debate could be better.

Edit - For example it's easy to say the city is ""screwing around"" with the homeless situation, but to not give what you would actually so different. The city had a decent homeless initiative that was stopped by residents in unison saying you're not putting transition centers in ""my neighborhood"". So how do you get past that? What is he going to do to fix the problem besides, say, not screwing around? Whatever that even means. Considering it's a top 3 initiative of his, he's provided no details whatsoever. 

He wants it all by saying, hey if you like the current administration, vote for me!

I'm curious how large complexes are more harmful? And I also thought [ORGANIZATION] doesn't allow visitors or drugs.

To the point of something outside the city, good luck getting the county to agree to that. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] hate homeless people to the point of calling them garbage.

Reasoning: The commenter provides observations on societal reactions (""scream NO""), expresses their own opinion (""I honestly dont care where they put it""), and references the opinions of others (""My neighbors would be pissed""). The critique touches on land allocation (money aid), the government's decision-making process, and societal NIMBY-ism.

"So, I've changed a lot on this one over time. I spent [ORGANIZATION] as an advocate working against chronic homelessness, have participated on some of the city's [LOCATION] on homelessness, etc, but I don't think the city, nor this take are being entirely generous.

1 - yes, housing first is scientifically the most effective model for caring for the homeless. It's math, not feelings. It [LOCATION] - but... housing first doesn't give free license to do housing first poorly. there are ways to do zero barrier in ways that are more harmful and less harmful.3 - less harmful = scattered site. less harmful = day shelter programming and a more controlled check in/check out process. more harmful = large complexes. more harmful (to the community) = no day programming, free roaming, full freedom, full visitation (allows for drug dealers)4 - Motels4Now has been good for the homeless, but harmful for many near it. It just has. Businesses have closed, people feel less safe, and it decreases the dignity and pride of the people near it (who - as those on the [ORGANIZATION] side - have already dealt with a lot of disinvestment). I'm not sure it's fair to help some people by harming some others, especially when it's just due to not being willing to produce the funding to do it in a [STREET] that is even more helpful and less harmful.I think at this point my preference would be something outside of city limits, on the edge of town where there's still zero restrictions on sobriety, but still a more programmatic or controlled environment. And let's pay for a shuttle that can connect people to the bus line. Surely a small shuttle bus and a full-time driver is within financial reason, given the total project will cost millions anyway.

I'm not saying my idea is the best one. But we at least have to have some compassion for the real expressed needs of neighbors and business owners without painting them out to be petty or greedy.

Reasoning: The author expresses their opinion (""ludicrous"") and describes what they believe others think (""happily ever after fairy tale""). They support their view with claims from ""personal experience"" and use a rhetorical question to cast doubt on the story. The critique is aimed at a non-governmental organization and public gullibility, making it a societal critique. The language used (""uneducated, former addict,"" ""rag tag...homeless addicts"") is a harmful generalization and implies a judgment about who is deserving or capable of running such an organization."
"Pretty strong rhetoric here. [ORGANIZATION] administers both homeless prevention assistance and housing assistance for thousands of people [ORGANIZATION]. And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. [ORGANIZATION] literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at [TIME] to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG2 does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

I'm very sorry to hear that you're having a hard time keeping up with building codes. I hope that you can make the adjustments required for you to continue helping people in a [STREET] that's safe, and I hope that you're able to continue to increase what you do for the community.

Reasoning: The comment presents an opinion about a city's need, framing it as a factual claim. It functions as a proposed solution (affordable housing) to an unstated problem, likely homelessness or housing insecurity. This implicitly critiques the city/government for a lack of action and suggests where resources should be allocated."
"[PERSON] the books is a semantical term, Itâs reflects a pattern of [DATE] they are rich and thriving and the next in a crises (the city basically refuses to admit itâs a rust belt city caught in the grip of global capitalism), as for [ORGANIZATION] it was more about [ORGANIZATION] than race.

Reasoning: The comment is a reaction to a video (media portrayal), providing observations about its content and expressing the opinion that the organization is exploiting the woman. It critiques the type of aid given (""body sprays"") as ineffective and enabling, which is a critique of resource allocation. By quoting another commenter and agreeing that one must ""hit your lowest low,"" it discusses a specific theory of intervention for addiction, which can be a harmful generalization. This also frames a deserving/undeserving narrative where the current help is seen as inappropriate for an addict."
"A lot of people commenting are assuming the people she's helping have a phone and can call for help themselves. Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss [PERSON]'s bc they know she has [LOCATION] and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break. 

I am not saying that there is or isn't a reason to be concerned, I don't know either [STREET], but some of the comments are petty [ORGANIZATION]. She's asking for immediate donations of food, shows the lack of food and the line of people and when the food is delivered they see the hungry people. She goes live all the time and shows the volunteers, donations and those she's helping. I think she is helping them and that those complaining or questioning haven't proven otherwise.

"I will try to save everyone [TIME] of their life by summarizing the Live video.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed a few complaints on her fb page.  First, she addressed the gal who expressed frustration of clothes, personal care bags, food, razors, feminine products being dumped around her home.  The woman asked miss [ORGANIZATION] volunteers to come pick it up since itâs a regular problem.  [ORGANIZATION] addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets [ORGANIZATION] while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.  That doesnât happen anymore,  but instead it became the neighbors problem.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at [ORGANIZATION]âs a few times and was angry at how she wasnât helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed it saying itâs because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers arenât sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her [STREET] is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is [ORGANIZATION] register [ORGANIZATION] may turn out to be a blessing for her, per [ORGANIZATION] (not in those words).  She canât comment on the article per the board, but so many people have offered support since the article so these things may get addressed by volunteers in the community.

It also critiques the organization's methods, such as allowing non-sober volunteers and judging who receives aid based on their appearance (societal critique, deserving/undeserving). The questions posed are rhetorical, designed to express skepticism about the organization's claims. The comment does not contain any racial bias."
"[ORGANIZATION]!!!.........

Please excuse my sarcasm and my bad dry jokes my humor I love to go sense of humor and a bad bad joke set [ORGANIZATION] but I am indeed just trying to keep this light because I really don't know what the problem is I have lived in [ORGANIZATION] for [DATE] and I just recently heard about Miss [PERSON]'s and maybe [ORGANIZATION] and I haven't heard anything but very good things about the establishment and her in general but again I mentioned personal experiencing I don't have to go into detail cuz it doesn't really matter but I I was helped greatly by Miss [PERSON] and never having met her in my entire life nor had she met me and I know that putting this down here but I bet you're wrong and I'm pretty transparent if anybody wants to know they can ask very easy to send somebody in private message but you know I'm not going to throw it out there it doesn't matter if I'm just going to say it's not I'm guessing it's probably not what you think unless you somehow or never mind whoever you I'm speaking of generally like whoever it is that has these issues and problems against Miss [PERSON] personally or Miss [PERSON]'s and in general I'm just curious I'd like to know why you taking such an interest in doing this and I wonder if it was you that had something to do with shut getting there needle exchange and shut down or any of the other things that help people that aren't perfect or that do things that you don't like I don't know I think that what my problem is more than anything else doesn't matter who it is or where it is or who these people are who you are who any thing related to whatever it is take what is is it your job to do this I just am wondering like again I'm going to say I'm just so curious as to what made you dislike the [STREET] so much that you're going to sit there and you're going to as far as I know slender I don't know that any of this is true I'd like to see your proof but I guess again I don't know anything about this and I'm just my anger is in the fact of that it's things like this that have the world set to where it is right now thank God you can't quit feeling things for [PERSON]'s sake hey come leave people alone is what I mean keep feeling it's the one [STREET] or another about things you don't like maybe your life would be a little bit happier but definitely like my mom would say leave people the f alone right I say quit feeling others just say let you I also noticed that you put down all of those things that must have took some time to get all that information and everything I sure hope that you're right about all of them and I'll end right now because I'm getting so irritated and going on and thinking about this but I noticed there wasn't anything I put out as far as how many meals have been served how many homeless people have been housed how many people have gotten to go to rehabilitation services that otherwise wouldn't have . How many rides have been given how many people have closed that didn't have clothes hygiene supplies that didn't have supplies if this [STREET] gets shut down are you going to help the people or you know complain more that there's people on the corners asking for money while you're complaining to get the places to help them shut down.

"1) Its close to [ORGANIZATION]. I love that its really quick to jump on the highway and be there in [TIME] or so. housing is less expensive

2) I hate the crime and gang violence that spills out of the west side of [PERSON]. it also acts like a catch all for the riff raff coming out of [ORGANIZATION]. the homeless is a growing issue too. 

The roads are crap because you get the worst of [ORGANIZATION] being down well below 0 for [LOCATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] are well above the 90s for [LOCATION]. the springs and falls are nice but its [ORGANIZATION] of each. 

[PERSON] is also a highly industrial area, except that was [PERSON]. alot of empty rusted dilapidated buildings that hipsters start a business in for [PERSON] then go under.

this area is extremely blue collar, the only thing that they like to do is go to bars. Not really a music or art culture here. just bars. 

people here cant [STREET] worth a shit. guys in [ORGANIZATION] are still wearing skater shoes with chain wallets. Moms smoke in their cars with their babies listening to papa roach. 

since they passed a gambling law, there are slots on every corner and in every [STREET] imaginable. They also passed another granting [PERSON] to build a casino [PERSON] or DATE8. So the people that live paycheck to paycheck that already have problems can go to surrender what they have left. But the city gets a bit of the profit, which you'll never see get implemented to benifit you in any [STREET]

3) I wish [PERSON] had one [STREET] that wasnt constantly covered in trash.

4) I would vist the surrounding towns in [PERSON], or even GPE2. but each town will have its own challenges. like when a chemical tool plants explodes and burns for [ORGANIZATION]#x200B;

Final thoughts: You might need to reconsider what youre willing to sacrifice for what you hope to gain. The [ORGANIZATION] is just one big cornfield of poverty. Im personally biased in that I hope a nuclear bomb goes off in this city. I would say that maybe just rent for [LOCATION]0 to experience the seasons and they [STREET] people act like here. Sure we dont have [ORGANIZATION] like you do in [LOCATION], but we have plenty of suicidal alcoholic domestic abusers that fly their freak flag here. So its a trade off.

Critique Category: []
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion (""imo"") as a claim about the homeless population. This creates a harmful generalization that a large percentage of people experiencing homelessness are not genuinely in need but are trying to scam people, which also falls under the deserving/undeserving perception by judging who is worthy of help."
"Most of those funds go to programs for housing and homeless prevention.They, for a while, also could go towards temporarily sheltering people. So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for [ORGANIZATION], or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for [LOCATION].  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in [STREET], and certain things that these funds simply can't help with. 

Then there's a couple programs that help people pay utility bills, but those are usually paid for with funds that are separate from what I was talking about before.",rockford,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim]

These questions about wait times and bed availability implicitly critique the allocation of resources and the government-run or regulated systems that manage them."
"The city has been practicing the [ORGANIZATION] program for [ORGANIZATION].  What housing first does is provide shelter first, and then addresses the person's other issues.  The city also put a lot of people up in rooms during [PERSON] because they got funding for it.  It makes no sense that [ORGANIZATION] would pay for people's rent. The city has been so successful with [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] is a model for other cities.  The city also collaborates with other agencies to reduce overlap and gaps.  However, the city employees can't post on social media about what they do.  [ORGANIZATION] rarely speaks of the work and programs of the city and other agencies.  

It isn't compassionate to supply people to live rough indefinitely, and put a strain on community spaces when bedding, tents, clothing, and food waste are dumped and abandoned buildings go up in flames.  It is reckless to give people hope that they can live sustainably with a cup of ramen, a few blankets and a tent in [LOCATION].  That is why no other agency in town provided materials to live outdoors, they provide shelter first.  However, the city can't force anyone to accept help, so there will always be un-sheltered people.

By the [STREET], most folks who are unhoused are not actually living on the streets or other public places.  Most are doubled-up with friends or family members, or living in motels/hotels.

This is exactly the issue exemplified in a lot of ways.

* Providing housing is a risky (leveraged) profit-making endeavor rather than a more stable public good
* When people don't have housing, it's much harder for them to actually spend time finding a steady job or other source of income

"Yeah, but specifically how? 

Tax rates for the wealthy are going down, not up. As you've seen in [ORGANIZATION] now, passing anything, even with democrats in power, is nearly impossible. Including tax hikes (fun fact: the bill being debated right now - is more than 25% tax cuts. As in the infrastructure bill is more than 25% tax cuts. And the Democrats are...in power, not the Republicans).

People always have simple answers to big problems, and these simple answers solve none of the problems. It is actually.... probably the saddest thing I've witnessed, in general over my life. 

We've said we would solve so much. Climate change, gun violence, equality, social mobility - and we've made zero progress on any of these. We've made negative progress, even. We can't even legalize marijuana at the federal level. 

Here's a simple solution to solving climate change; just do it. Just do it. Easy, right?

People on this subreddit keep asking the same questions, and providing the same simple answers. And yet they are amazed that they are unsatisfied with the results. Here's what the people asking these questions don't want to hear; invite the homeless in to your house. Or take your paycheck, and buy a house for the homeless person, or buy the homeless person a [ORGANIZATION] at a hotel. These are actual solutions that any of us can do. It just takes sacrifice from us. How many of us do you see making these sacrifices? None. 

We literally cannot even raise taxes. So it's just.... exhausting in a sense (trying to... demonstrate the gridlock, the partisanship, the need for solutions that can actually pass [PERSON]).

Reasoning: The commenter provides facts about government phone programs and expresses the opinion that society has a duty to provide basic needs, discussing the use of tax dollars for this purpose (money aid allocation/societal critique). The comment expresses a desire for a solution (""a hand up""). However, it also contains conflicting perceptions, shifting from compassion to resentment. The final paragraph describes negative personal interactions and uses them to make harmful generalizations about PEH being ""deceitful"" and ""ungrateful,"" which creates a deserving/undeserving dichotomy based on their behavior.

The comment generalizes a negative action to ""the homeless and mentally incapacitated"" and insists they conduct this behavior ""elsewhere,"" which is a classic ""not in my backyard"" stance.

"The difficulty with issues like homelessness is that much money has gone into addressing it without success. Just housing everyone who is homeless doesnt work.

A surprisingly large percentage of the population has an iq too low even for the military. Here is an area of research where in which you could come up with a revolutionary solution!) If this were not the case immigrants would not risk their lives to come here and find success. This is still the land of opportunity.

Reasoning: The comment expresses the opinion that American society provides ample opportunity and that homelessness is a result of individual choice or incapability (low IQ), not systemic failure. It makes claims about the ineffectiveness of financial aid (""much money has gone into addressing it without success"") and critiques the ""just housing everyone"" solution. It makes harmful generalizations about homeless people and creates a deserving/undeserving dichotomy based on their perceived choices or inherent capabilities.

They wind up homeless, no fixed address, and then if they do reoffend itâs harder to find them.

There should be a monitored halfway house for those kinds of offenders- but thatâs a small number of the total unhoused population.

They use a rhetorical question about a child's safety to emphasize their point. This expresses a ""not in my backyard"" sentiment about the use of public space and relies on the harmful generalization that the presence of homeless people inherently makes an area unsafe.

They reference the opinions of others on the subreddit and make a claim about a body being found. The comment critiques the management of public space and what they perceive as societal acceptance of the issue.

Reasoning: The commenter asks a genuine question (""Do you have a source for this?""), provides claims (""I imagine many... have extended families or charities""), and expresses their opinion by explicitly narrowing their personal definition of ""unhoused"". This act of redefining the term serves as a societal critique of how homelessness is understood and categorized. By distinguishing between ""people living on the streets"" and those on lists with other support systems, the commenter creates a hierarchy, implying one group is more authentically ""unhoused"" than the other, which is a form of deserving/undeserving judgment.

The comment critiques the neighbor's hostile behavior, which is a form of societal cruelty, extreme NIMBYism, and is based on a harmful generalization that people in camps are disposable.

How exactly does raising taxes help homeless people? There are plenty of resources already available for them. Most homeless people I see are at the FAC0 exit directly across from the FAC1 employment building. They should turn around and walk in.

Under state and federal law that person (the homeless person) has to provide me a [STREET] of employment with phone #, current address and a method in which they are going to pay the rent aka you have to have a job.  Personally I dont care if you have a job, but no rental application is going to approve someone with no working phone, no job, no current address etc etc.  Everything is ran through a credit background and sexual background check and most people in situation are not going to pass just due to things like no bank account, no working phone, or no trasportation or previous address, no employment.

"There were **two competing housing resolutions** that were introduced to [ORGANIZATION] [TIME].

1. One was crafted by citizens through grass-roots groups like ORG1, ORG2, others) and asked for a Housing Crisis be declared, a committee/task force formed, and a city staff member hired to focus on solutions.
2. The other was sponsored by five [ORGANIZATION] members and proposed no action, but made a declaration of efforts they've taken to address housing. PERSON0 led this one and the FOIA'd e-mails made him seem offended that other's hard work was going unnoticed.

Read more here: [[URL]

What I think was strange about [PERSON]'s version was that it over-emphasized the [ORGANIZATION]'s efforts on housing insecurity and homelessness. Those are important things that align with my personal values, but that's not what we're talking about. We need to increase housing supply and expedite its production so that people just have options of places to live. I believe we're making steady progress doing this like removing commercial parking requirements, creating pre-approved design plans for infill developments downtown, FAC0 improvement plan...but there are some critical approaches we have not addressed. They are local actions that impact housing supply and local prices:

* **Hire another planner or two** to work with landowners to rezone more properties to allow housing in more places (e.g. FAC0 improvement project that's underway or our [ORGANIZATION] in our [ORGANIZATION] Plan 2040 our city refuses to act on). 
* You know those brownstones in [ORGANIZATION]? Triple-deckers in [PERSON]? They are illegal to build in most of our city due to zoning. **Reform our development code.** I believe it's a problem that it's easier to build sprawling subdivisions, and harder to build compact and traditional living. We need to change the code from [ORGANIZATION] zoning to form-based zoning. [PERSON] and [PERSON] are addressing this with a world-renowned consultant right now. If [PERSON] chooses to fall behind those two cities in urban planning, it will be laughable. 
* **Reduce/reform parking minimums** for residential (maybe using overlay districts) and simultaneously invest in transit. [PERSON] is offering cities in [PERSON] a match for transit investment (design of bus stops) and the [ORGANIZATION] has not taken them up on it. 
* [ORGANIZATION] councilmembers: **Stop holding rezone requests hostage.** 

Personally, I'm mostly annoyed that it seems several councilmembers don't recognize that [PERSON] **has made great progress** ***and*** **can do more.** There IS work to be done ...do they see that? I'm concerned that they know, they just don't want it.

"Iâm curious, what exactly did you do to help before? I ask because, as someone formerly homeless I literally had maybe a handful of people who actually offered any kind of material help and usually it really wasnât much.

In fact, when I was denied [ORGANIZATION] benefits for the second time because I was foolish enough to mention during the phone interview, after all the paperwork I completed and having to wait [ORGANIZATION] for the opportunity to get  1 phone call I better not miss or have to start all over, that I mentioned I sometimes would prepare and have meals with my girlfriend. And I was denied because I refused to do as they ask and go to this woman, one of the few people who actually stood by me and saw me get out of that situation, my real guardian angel, that I felt it was inappropriate for me to then have to ask her for her [ORGANIZATION], every detail of her personal finances, ask for her college transcript, take all this very detailed personal information making her vulnerable to whoever had it and turn it over to the county and state just so I could get a couple hundred a month I could use and only use making sure I, at the very least, had food in my stomach.

When I was a homeless man, asking one of the very few programs that offer any kind of help or relief just for the help of food was denied that help. And to have that be the second time of paperwork and waiting and phone interviews and then waiting some more just to find out that our system denied a working homeless person who because of pride had put off even asking for help until I realized why not her help if itâs there. Thatâs when I realized it actually wasnât there.

People talk a lot about âall the things the homeless getâ and as you said yourself theyâre âfreeloadersâ without realizing that in fact most get little to anything and the ones who do get somethingâs had to and have to continually fight and work to keep getting anything. All while living in a constant state of stress and trauma.

The fact is, and this is a fact you can look at the numbers yourself, we spend [STREET] more money on the bureaucracy we require to deny people help than we spend on the help that we go to great lengths to make it as difficult and shameful as we possibly can make it to get. 

That woman who had that [TIME] long phone interview with me, who Iâm sure is a good and kind person trying to survive like the rest of us, that woman was getting payed. And as an employee of the city and county of [ORGANIZATION] was likely making near 6 figures if not in fact 6 figures. And we as a society payed her that sum on [LOCATION] to find a reason to deny a homeless person, sober, working and struggling, we denied a homeless person food.

So, when you say you used to do what you could to help people, besides the tax dollars that are spent âhelpingâ in the [STREET] I described above, what exactly was that help? Youâd occasionally give some coins to someone to leave you alone? Youâd occasionally decide not to call the police on someone who other than being unsightly was causing no other real harm or disturbance.

Because call me crazy, but Iâm maybe a little suspicious of the guy saying heâd happily look the other [STREET] if the city decided to âcrack some headsâ  that maybe just maybe you in fact have never really been much help to the people youâre here advocating state violence against so casually and brazenly.

Something tells me you likely would do more for a stray dog then to address in any helpful or constructive [STREET] the human misery we all have to see everyday and that pieces of shit who sound an awful lot like you do do everything in their power to undermine and put requirements on which end up increasing the costs to all of our tax dollars, not just you but all the people who actually give a damn about other human beings want actually spent on just helping people the fuck out when theyâre in a tight spot.

Donât bother with any of the usual âIâm glad to hear your doing betterâ or any of that crap because i already know what you think about me because of it and i guarantee you I know who you think is to blame for me being in that circumstance and Iâm tired of hearing fake niceties by people who are so morally bankrupt that i already know that the time I took here to ask a basic fucking question and safeguard it from the usual bad faith horseshit thatâs always employed to side step these things is almost for sure just a waste of my fucking time and effort because your not gonna hear a god damn word of what I have to say.

Cause thatâs how you solve your problems in life.

Reasoning: The text is a dialogue between users debating policy. It includes opinions (""camping needs to be banned""), rhetorical questions (""So they should be thrown in jail?""), and factual claims (citing a URL for the cause of homelessness). The discussion critiques government policy and the allocation of financial resources, while also proposing and debating various solutions/interventions (banning camping vs. housing/treatment). The initial quoted comment reflects a ""not in my backyard"" stance. The comment does not contain any racial bias."

Critique Category: [money aid allocation, government critique, societal critique]

Perception Type: [not in my backyard]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on what the ""biggest issue"" is, framing it as a factual claim that money is available but land is not due to citizen opposition (NIMBYism). This serves as a critique of both societal attitudes and governmental inability to secure land. The comment also implicitly suggests that finding a willing community is the necessary solution."

The police especially do not tolerate homeless people.

The comment is focused on economic class and does not contain any racial bias."

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on the feasibility of city policies and proposes a solution (""sweeps of large problem camps"") as an intervention.

The use of the term ""service resistant"" is a harmful generalization that creates a distinction between those who are and are not willing to accept help, which frames a deserving/undeserving narrative."

Reasoning: The commenter uses a rhetorical question to challenge the opinion that individuals are 100% at fault for their homelessness. They then make a claim comparing the scale of the problem in the [ORGANIZATION] to other developed countries, which serves as a societal and governmental critique, suggesting systemic issues rather than individual failings are the root cause."

"Not all homeless are criminals.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion that poverty is not a crime and proposes solutions based on individual circumstances (prison for crime, mental hospital for illness). This critiques both government policy (""incarceration first"") and societal attitudes that criminalize poverty. It directly pushes back against the harmful generalization that all homeless people are criminals and makes judgments about what different groups deserve. There is no racial bias in the statement."

">""increased law enforcement"" implies people want more cops.

How has this become the takeaway for people from this article? It's hardly the main point.

First of all, we need both - the cops we have need to do a better job of enforcing the laws, and we need more cops to cover more areas, more consistently, and to make sure there is sufficient availability for them to respond whenever a call for assistance comes in, even if it's not an immediate emergency. 

But the real issue here is something else entirely - that by a clear majority, people in this city are sick and tired of people simply being allowed to do whatever they want, wherever they want, without consequence. Not because they're not compassionate, not because they don't understand that many people who are homeless truly got there through no fault of their own or that most of us could relatively easily end up in the same situation, but because they realize that for those that struggle the most to make responsible choices, an overall approach that prioritizes permissiveness and enabling is the worst possible ""solution"" - for them and for the rest of us.

"Yeah, while some homeless are fine enough the issue with places like this is that you'll often concentrate the worst of them.",baltimore,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: [not in my backyard, harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion as a claim, suggesting that concentrating services for the homeless inevitably concentrates ""the worst of them."" This is a critique of a societal approach to homelessness solutions. It creates a harmful generalization by dividing the homeless population into ""fine enough"" and ""the worst,"" which is a form of deserving/undeserving judgment, and implies a ""not in my backyard"" stance."
"No, they aren't forced there. he said jail because I said FAC0 beds, and he got lost and said the first thing that made sense to him.

I said forced Inpatient treatment for drug addicts.

Those are people who would otherwise be in prison.

And FAC0 is not helping anyone.

Inpatient treatment for [ORGANIZATION] with rehabilitation and job training is the solution to any drug-related [ORGANIZATION].

[ORGANIZATION]-related [ORGANIZATION] should also be forcible Inpatient treatment.
We could perhaps have something on our IDs that says we are able to buy and order alcohol, and are not being abusive to our families, or becoming homeless because of [ORGANIZATION].

And all Americans should have universal healthcare, and inpatient treatment for drug and alcohol and mental health should all be covered.",portland,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by proposing several specific, large-scale solutions (forced inpatient treatment, universal healthcare, ID system for alcohol), which function as a critique of current government and societal approaches. The comment makes broad generalizations about people with addiction and creates a deserving/undeserving framework for who should be allowed to purchase alcohol. No racial bias is present."

"I get what you are saying but sleeping in the [STREET] is not a reasonable answer either.  

If this was somewhere that was warm [ORGANIZATION] then that would be better in some respects but it gets freezing cold here.  Then you have to factor in being somewhere dry and thankfully it doesn't seem that homeless people aren't being harassed here but you still have some pretty rough conditions.

For a person without mental or addiction issues not having friends or family is a real issue as well. 

Of course, I'm not touching the [ORGANIZATION] situation with a ten foot pole due to the [STREET] that has affected the world.",baltimore,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion]

"Yeah how about just letting me slide on my outfuckingrageous property taxes [ORGANIZATION] GPE0. It'll only cost a few thousand bucks and you'll prevent me from being homeless. MFers.

You already know the only purpose of this plan for more city officials to line their pockets and get favors from big developers. They probably won't even manage to get a single homeless person off the [STREET]",baltimore,"Comment Type: [ask a rhetorical question, provide a fact or claim, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [money aid allocation, government critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: []
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter uses a rhetorical question to express frustration with their own property taxes. They then express the cynical opinion, framed as a claim, that the city's plan to address homelessness is a corrupt scheme to benefit officials and developers, thereby critiquing the government and its allocation of money. The comment does not contain stereotypes about homeless people or any racial bias."
"I'm glad you're able to speak about it in the past tense, but whether it's ever true isn't really the point. It's that of all the reasons an unhoused person may not be in a shelter (for instance, access or safety), it's the emphasis on the one that's that person's fault.

To say the very least, as no cause of death has been reported, it's entirely possible one or both were COVID-related.",baltimore,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: []
Perception Type: []
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The speaker expresses their opinion on the societal tendency to blame unhoused individuals for not using shelters. They observe that this focus ignores other potential reasons like access or safety and provide a claim that a cause of death in a related case is unreported, countering speculation. This is a critique of a common societal attitude."
"Tell your landlord, file a miscellaneous 311 request, and then contact your city councillor's office and include your landlord's [ORGANIZATION] the 311 request #

You could also call [ORGANIZATION] and see if they can send a community health worker out to see him, but it's usually a looong process for them to develop a rapport",baltimore,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, express their opinion]
Critique Category: [government critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: []
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The comment is focused on providing concrete actions and solutions, such as contacting a landlord, 311, a city councillor, and a community health organization. It includes a factual claim about the available procedures and expresses an opinion that the process is often slow, which serves as a mild critique of the government/organizational system in place. The comment does not contain any of the listed perception types or racial bias."
"This is [ORGANIZATION], you can't expect to come here and live like it's the suburbs. Is this guy causing any problems beyond trying to survive?

Critique Category: [societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [personal interaction]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The comment asks a rhetorical question to challenge the original poster's premise, provides a claim about the harmlessness of PEH, and expresses an opinion on what the OP should worry about instead. It critiques societal attitudes by contrasting urban reality with suburban expectations and suggests a direct intervention (talking to the person), which is based on the author's stated personal interactions with PEH. The comment contains no racial bias."
"I lived in [ORGANIZATION], including a stint living near [ORGANIZATION], and an am now in [PERSON]. I don't find [PERSON] to have the same kind of homeless camps and culture that [ORGANIZATION] had.

"[ORGANIZATION] has been housing homeless people in hotels throughout the pandemic. This program has been extended through [ORGANIZATION] and will probably be extended through [LOCATION].

 [[ORGANIZATION] will keep homeless in hotels through [ORGANIZATION], but hasnât tapped federal money set aside to pay for [ORGANIZATION][URL]

>[ORGANIZATION] will continue housing about 500 homeless residents in hotel rooms at least through [ORGANIZATION], extending a program designed to prevent the spread of [ORGANIZATION], even though it has not yet applied for $35 million in federal money that would pay for it. 

These hotels are probably not 5 star rated and the view may not be as nice as the [PERSON] waterfront. However, it would seem to be much better than living in a tent long term. The hotels not only provide shelter and safety, but electricity, running water, bathrooms, heat, A/C, change of towels and bed linen and probably cable TV. 

It seems that there is a short term solution already in [STREET] for the few tents that have sprung up in [PERSON] as well as longer term solutions that are being planned.

Perception Type: [deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The user states their opinion and a claim about their personal policy of not giving to panhandlers, instead donating to charities. This choice reflects a decision on money aid allocation and is presented as their personal solution. This implies a judgment that organized charities are more ""deserving"" or a more effective recipient of aid than individuals who panhandle."

"So what if the people don't want / aren't able to work or live in a house?  It's pretty hard to force them.  How do you keep people off the benches and steps outside while running a soup kitchen?  They'll camp close to the food sources.

While a tent city is possibly a step too far, we shouldn't forget that it's been doing this longer than just about any government in the world has been around.

Critique Category: [government critique, societal critique]
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter asks rhetorical questions about the difficulty of forcing people into housing and managing service locations. They offer opinions on the limits of intervention (""a tent city is possibly a step too far"") and make factual claims about the historical role of the church, contrasting it with government. The comment generalizes that people will camp near food sources and implies some may not want help, which touches on deservingness. There is no racial bias present."
"Simple: get a pot of water, boil the water, add sugar and more sugar until it's super saturated. Get one of those giant squirt guns, let solution cool. Spray front yard /steps with the solution.

Critique Category: []
Response Category: [solutions/interventions]
Perception Type: [not in my backyard, harmful generalization, deserving/undeserving]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by proposing a hostile ""solution"" to keep homeless people away from their property. This action is a clear example of a ""not in my backyard"" mentality. It also relies on a ""harmful generalization"" by treating all homeless people as a single pest-like entity and implies they are ""undeserving"" of basic human decency. There is no racial bias present in the comment."
"> They were congregating on the streets

Article says ""individuals that are over [ORGANIZATION] and residing in city shelters"".  And I don't see anything in the article about them being drug users. Can't just make every homeless person an addict or someone with a mental health issue. The people running the program have selected a subset of people, likely those who they think can function in this new environment, and the officials seem to be making it clear that they are working with businesses, not putting folks in places that don't want them there. Hotel owners might have stepped up and answered the call, as we look out for all of our citizens during this pandemic.  We have the [[LOCATION] Unites]([URL] campaign going, and a lot of folks are stepping up to help out their fellow citizens.

Perception Type: [media portrayal, harmful generalization]
racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion by referencing a scene from the movie ""The Other Guys."" This is a clear use of media portrayal to frame a perception of people experiencing homelessness. The content of the reference (a ""homeless man orgy"") is a negative and shocking stereotype, making it a harmful generalization."
"In [ORGANIZATION], if you panhandle for 5hrs (more exhausting then you think), you will probably have 30-50 tops.  That is if the cops dont write you a ticket for $100.00 or you just get moved on.

Reasoning: The commenter provides claims and personal observations to counter what they perceive as a common societal misconception (""stories about panhandlers making a ton of money""). This acts as a societal critique. It also includes a critique of government action, specifically police ticketing panhandlers. The reference to ""stories"" can be seen as a critique of media portrayal or general public discourse."
"I'm not sure why your tone is so aggressive.

That's correct, she is the mayor. Not some omnipotent superhero. One of her stronger focuses really has been on the homelessness issue. But the squeegee issue? I know its inconvenient and frustrating to have your car kicked or your blade flipped up, but I still think there are more pressing matters in the city. You seem to equate people begging and squeegee boys, but I don't think they are the same. 

I'm not here to defend the mayor, as I'm not her spokesperson, so I'm not sure why you're asking me about what shes done to address other issues in the city.

Reasoning: The commenter asks genuine questions to understand the other user's reasoning (""I'm not sure why your tone is so aggressive""). They provide a claim about the mayor's focus on homelessness and express their opinion that the ""squeegee issue"" is less important than other problems. This is a form of societal critique, as they are questioning another person's (and by extension, a potential societal) focus on a specific, visible aspect of poverty over broader issues. The comment contains no racial bias."

racist: [No]
Reasoning: The commenter expresses their personal opinion and justification for not helping. It contains a harmful generalization by associating all homeless people with the potential for lethal violence (""stabbed to death""). The statement ""I have my own people to take care of"" creates a deserving/undeserving dichotomy, prioritizing their own group over a person experiencing homelessness."

Reasoning: The user provides a fact about an organization's service (holding mail), which is a type of intervention. They then express an opinion that creates a dichotomy between ""incidentally homeless"" people who seek help and ""chronically"" homeless people who are on the streets for ""a reason."" This is a harmful generalization that oversimplifies the causes of chronic homelessness and implies a judgment about who is deserving versus undeserving of assistance."

The comment includes a harmful generalization (""I don't believe anything the panhandlers say"") but also pushes back on the concept of deserving/undeserving by stating they won't judge how the money is spent."

This is a critique of society, government, and resource allocation. The comment includes a rhetorical question and proposes a ""solution"" (forcing people to get jobs).

Reasoning: The comment starts by expressing an opinion (""Nobody should be homeless"") and then asks a rhetorical question to make the point that the dangerous conditions some homeless people face (violence in abandoned houses) are also unacceptable. This critiques the societal conditions that allow for such unsafe situations."
"I feel like this housing trust is a bit ridiculous.  We already fund a ton of public housing in this city and rents in this city are already some of the cheapest on [LOCATION].   Things like this also often spend a ton of money to help relatively few people.

A great analogy- Think about who buys new cars versus used cars. It's not all that different. Yet, as [ORGANIZATION] points out, ""There's no outcry about [ORGANIZATION]'s affordable car crisis""âbecause [ORGANIZATION] has plenty of affordable cars, just not affordable brand new cars.

With that being said, you have no idea what youâre talking about. As far as I know the shelter system sucks. Mental health treatment is even worse (best case scenario is you get DATE0 in FAC0 and get dumped back on the [STREET] but thatâs only after like a major psychotic episode). Both housing and healthcare are expensive which is no good for homeless people, in fact itâs probably why their homeless. And your blaming their family?

To now learn that family members staged this brutal killing is beyond belief and represents a double tragedy.

"[ORGANIZATION] isn't as cheap for housing as people say. Apparently they haven't rented an apartment or room in [ORGANIZATION] or FAC0 in awhile. If they did they would know at those prices you usually only get a craphole.

Jobs here are great if you know people, if you social network you can make money in this town. If you are secluded and keep to yourself chances are you will only make min wage or just above.

There is a huge income disparity in ORGANIZATION.
I have found myself homeless here twice in [ORGANIZATION]. 

Once because of a job that closed (FAC1). Another time because I rented one of those *reasonably* priced apartments and dealt with a crazy landlord who would often come into my apartment. Sometimes when I was home, others when I was not home. That's just the start of it.

(Disclaimer: Being white and educated doesn't mean you aren't poor, a lot of people are educated here and job competition is vicious.)
I am white.
I have a DATE1 degree.
I do smoke pot, so that has definitely been a huge obstacle for me to overcome in regards to professional jobs.
But other than that I do not drink, take pills or other drugs.

So other than that, [ORGANIZATION] can be a great city to live in.
But the downsides are the nepotism, cold, income disparity, high rental prices, lack of reasonable bus system(that arrives on time or to the suburbs), [ORGANIZATION] collar/non-union).

"This is a good point. I'm not sure if you're using this as an argument that people WANT segregation, or if you're just pointing out something you've seen, but the idea of gentrification brings attention to how out-of-balance things are. 

Gentrification is fucking awesome to people who own property, right? Like - if I bought a home for $40k and suddenly that neighborhood became the [STREET] to be, I'd be pumped to earn over 1000% on my investment over [ORGANIZATION]. 

But let's face it: **Gentrification is happening in places where the people living there do NOT own property.** They're tenants renting someone else's property. The ""kind"" landlords will raise rent to merely catch up with tax assessments and basic inflation, the rest of them will go ""the market value has changed"" (I put ""kind"" in quotes because very, very, very few landlords are anything but exploitative). 

***

So when we look at answering questions about systemic racism and living/property costs and wealth, a few things come up:

- Generational wealth is a concept that has positively impacted whites at a higher rate than [ORGANIZATION]. Everything from slavery to [ORGANIZATION] to redlining so every other flavor of systemic racism, the privilege of building and passing on generational wealth isn't afforded to many [ORGANIZATION]. Escaping the poverty loop is hard enough - and when you don't have generational wealth to build/pass on, you're stuck renting and hoping you don't get gentrified out of your living situation.
 - With no generational wealth, you greatly reduce the likelihood that the affected person can purchase a home
 - YES - white people deal with this too, albeit on a less-proportional level, and without the many other roadblocks. It needs to be understood that certain measures that may benefit [ORGANIZATION] may benefit whites in this same position...
- Accessibility to homes for those who might actually be in a position to purchase is waning. If you're [ORGANIZATION] from the east side and you want to remain in the community you grew up in, you might be looking at the east side. You might find something that's within your price range. You might also learn that your home's value may not appreciate faster than the rate of inflation because of where you are.
 - ""Crime!"" some of the neolibs and conservatives will cry. ""It's that [STREET] because of crime! Fix the crime and values will go up!"" Perhaps - but tell me how much that value actually goes up when the sounds of the 33 drown out your backyard [ORGANIZATION].
 - Hidden barriers. Aside from the pseudo-redlining that still happens among [ORGANIZATION], those $40,000 homes on the east side often require additional money to make them comfortably habitable. 
- NIMBY will always be a huge roadblock. Every time anyone ever mentions ""affordable housing"" - whether it's an income-based apartment complex or some allocation for some affordable path to home ownership, people make a stink. They will fight for ""those people"" to go back to to the [STREET] they belong and then use every dog whistle, holier-than-thou argument, and sob story about how the safety of their neighborhood is at risk.",buffalo,"Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, ask a rhetorical question, provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions]

I'd also push back on the idea there was no housing crisis in [LOCATION], since urban renewal efforts targeting ""overcrowded"" black neighborhoods began soon after WWII, as black renters were not allowed in many ""higher end"" (white) neighborhoods.

"And they're asking people to donate food, clothing, and baby supplies -- not tents. As a lifelong democrat, no I am not universally opposed to social programs.

The reality is that the [ORGANIZATION] could donate the tent and camping supplies to a local nonprofit that could make good use of it. This is not as flashy or righteous as giving it to LGBTQ homeless people. The best outcome is someone pops a tent on the sidewalk, neighbors and local businesses call police immediately because encampments are not normalized here, and the tent is thrown in the trash. Worst outcome is someone pops the tent on private property and they are verbally/physically threatened before their tent is thrown away.

You can empathize with the homeless and gladly pay taxes to support people. You don't have to allow encampments to spring up in public places.

"Yep, i used to live in [ORGANIZATION] where I taught English.

One of them had a woman who was outside of his store for [ORGANIZATION], rain or shine, in heat or cold. Her son was in prison, and she was trying to raise money to get an apartment for herself and him so that he would have a [STREET] to go when he got out. She was very friendly and never asked anyone for money outright - just would give a friendly ""hi"" and have [DATE].And if people gave her money, she would thank them, and she saved every penny - never used any on herelf so my friend let her get water/food from inside. I would stop and chat with her sometimes, that's how I know why she was out there. My friend let her stay out there all the [STREET] until she had the money to get her own [STREET]. I remember the last time I saw her, she updated me and told me she had got a [STREET] and was now trying to find some cheap furniture. I haven't seen her out there since, so  I'm glad that she made it.

My other friend who manages another [ORGANIZATION], had a guy there who he exchanged food and drinks for cleaning up the outside of the property and emptying the trash.  That worked out well for [LOCATION]. I would see this guy there all the time and it worked out well for both of them until recently -  he had to finally kick the guy out because he started bringing his friends who were  addicts and they started building a makeshift house on the side of the building and were kind of creeping the customers out.

But yeah, if you go inside and talk to the managers of one of these gas stations, a lot of them will work something out  with you.",elpaso,"Comment Type: [provide an observation, express their opinion]

Reasoning: The commenter shares observations based on personal interactions and stories from friends to support their opinion, which is framed as advice for PEH. It suggests an informal solution/intervention by approaching gas station managers. By contrasting the ""friendly"" woman who saved her money and succeeded with the man who was kicked out after his friends caused trouble, the comment creates an implicit narrative of who is deserving of help."

Reasoning: The commenter asks a question to clarify what type of unhoused person is being discussed, then shares a personal observation and a claim about ""migrants"" displacing the ""homeless people."" This creates a distinction between two vulnerable groups, which can be interpreted as a judgment of who is more ""deserving"" of a space. The use of ""migrants"" as a distinct category in opposition to ""homeless people"" often carries implicit racial bias, as the term is frequently used as a coded reference to specific ethnic or national groups, framing them as outsiders."
