Reasoning: In this case, we see criticism directed at society's lack of awareness regarding different types of homelessness which could lead to negative consequences due to proximity between facilities serving certain groups versus schools within neighborhoods. There's also concern expressed concerning potential misallocation of funds meant specifically for aiding various forms of poverty-stricken communities.

"The meeting was a great showing of varying community opinion. Went from [TIME].

\- PERSON0 got truly irate

\- PERSON1 (mayors office) got called out for unintentionally lying and providing partial information [ORGANIZATION] night to council. [TIME] before the meeting too.

\- The main guy from [ORGANIZATION] said FAC0 started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after [TIME] when there is no presence on site. Some lady from [ORGANIZATION] who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to [LOCATION] and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- [ORGANIZATION] got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until [TIME]) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- [ORGANIZATION] and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- PERSON2 of [ORGANIZATION] berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from ORG2 essentially said the same thing. [ORGANIZATION] also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes [TIME] the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which [ORGANIZATION] said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with [ORGANIZATION] apologized because they were voting against.

\- PERSON4 also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly [ORGANIZATION] employees, and people like PERSON4 who only took up [TIME] total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give [TIME] to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition [TIME]?

\- [ORGANIZATION] had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the [ORGANIZATION] project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the [STREET]. [ORGANIZATION] kept repeating they asked their consultant (DATE2) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as [ORGANIZATION] while giving numerous sites labels of [LOCATION]. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- PERSON6 tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter ([ORGANIZATION]) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""[INSTITUTION]"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. [ORGANIZATION] said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 [PERSON] meetings, 1 of which is attended. The [PERSON] barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in [ORGANIZATION] without a site in mind so then it became urgent in [LOCATION] to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around DATE4. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side?

i'm sorry if i'm wrong but i'd say it's probably due to lack of education rather than laziness...

the reason being most likely why these folks can't find jobs even tho they're willing to do anything is becuase they've never learned basic skills needed to get hired in today's world..

they've also lost interest in learning new ones once they got comfortable living off welfare..so basically there's nothing left inside them anymore except wanting free stuff..
this makes me sad cause i'll bet half of 'em could actually learn alot faster if they'd try harder instead of blaming everyone else for whatever went wrong in life including themselves..

it doesn't matter where you're born either; anyone's potential should still count regardless of circumstances..

if that's true maybe someday they'll realize what's really holding them down & take responsibility for fixing it before it's too late otherwise it'll continue getting worse until eventually nobody will care enough to give out food stamps anymore :(

It [LOCATION] - but... housing first doesn't give free license to do housing first poorly. there are ways to do zero barrier in ways that are more harmful and less harmful.3 - less harmful = scattered site. less harmful = day shelter programming and a more controlled check in/check out process. more harmful = large complexes. more harmful (to the community) = no day programming, free roaming, full freedom, full visitation (allows for drug dealers)4 - Motels4Now has been good for the homeless, but harmful for many near it. It just has. Businesses have closed, people feel less safe, and it decreases the dignity and pride of the people near it (who - as those on the [ORGANIZATION] side - have already dealt with a lot of disinvestment). I'm not sure it's fair to help some people by harming some others, especially when it's just due to not being willing to produce the funding to do it in a [STREET] that is even more helpful and less harmful.I think at this point my preference would be something outside of city limits, on the edge of town where there's still zero restrictions on sobriety, but still a more programmatic or controlled environment. And let's pay for a shuttle that can connect people to the bus line. Surely a small shuttle bus and a full-time driver is within financial reason, given the total project will cost millions anyway.

I'm not saying my idea is the best one. But we at least have to have some compassion for the real expressed needs of neighbors and business owners without painting them out to be petty or greedy.

My mom has been working at [ORGANIZATION] since she graduated college back in '92. She's always had strong beliefs against giving money away without knowing where it's going...

We lost everything except two cats--we still can't find any trace of most things we're sure we'd left behind before leaving New Orleans forever.

We've done nothing wrong; that's why they're asking if we'll take care of ourselves instead of being given food by strangers walking along the streets begging for handouts while wearing tattered clothes stained with blood and urine. We're poor enough already having gone through such tragedy recently....but somehow these beggars seem much poorer than anyone else i've met anywhere else i go outside of town. Do they really need $20 bucks each week?? Or do they simply want attention?

"Pretty strong rhetoric here. [ORGANIZATION] administers both homeless prevention assistance and housing assistance for thousands of people [ORGANIZATION]. And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. [ORGANIZATION] literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at [TIME] to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG2 does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

I'm very sorry to hear that you're having a hard time keeping up with building codes.

The only reason someone has been able to get away without being arrested at least once since moving into our area last year seems to me to come down to two things; first his/her appearance which makes him/her blend right in among us locals, second he/she lives out front near the corner store owned by Mr. Smith whose son works there part time during high season months. He never calls the cops even if he's seen something suspicious going on outside while working late hours after closing until now.

Mr. Smith's daughter also rents apartments upstairs under rent control regulations set forth back in '76 before anyone ever heard of gentrification.

"A lot of people commenting are assuming the people she's helping have a phone and can call for help themselves. Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss [PERSON]'s bc they know she has [LOCATION] and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break. 

I am not saying that there is or isn't a reason to be concerned, I don't know either [STREET], but some of the comments are petty [ORGANIZATION]. She's asking for immediate donations of food, shows the lack of food and the line of people and when the food is delivered they see the hungry people. She goes live all the time and shows the volunteers, donations and those she's helping. I think she is helping them and that those complaining or questioning haven't proven otherwise. 

I don't see anyone else in the neighborhood helping our most vulnerable residents 24/7 with a sack lunch and no questions asked. Everyone deserves and needs food to survive.",rockford,"provide a fact or claim, offer observations, express their opinion",,,"]

[ORGANIZATION] addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets [ORGANIZATION] while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at [ORGANIZATION]‚Äôs a few times and was angry at how she wasn‚Äôt helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed it saying it‚Äôs because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers aren‚Äôt sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her [STREET] is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is [ORGANIZATION] register [ORGANIZATION] may turn out to be a blessing for her, per [ORGANIZATION] (not in those words).

"The city has been practicing the [ORGANIZATION] program for [ORGANIZATION].  What housing first does is provide shelter first, and then addresses the person's other issues.

However, the city employees can't post on social media about what they do.  [ORGANIZATION] rarely speaks of the work and programs of the city and other agencies.  

It isn't compassionate to supply people to live rough indefinitely, and put a strain on community spaces when bedding, tents, clothing, and food waste are dumped and abandoned buildings go up in flames.  It is reckless to give people hope that they can live sustainably with a cup of ramen, a few blankets and a tent in [LOCATION].

"Most of those funds go to programs for housing and homeless prevention.They, for a while, also could go towards temporarily sheltering people. So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for [ORGANIZATION], or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for [LOCATION].  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in [STREET], and certain things that these funds simply can't help with.

Tax rates for the wealthy are going down, not up. As you've seen in [ORGANIZATION] now, passing anything, even with democrats in power, is nearly impossible. Including tax hikes (fun fact: the bill being debated right now - is more than 25% tax cuts. As in the infrastructure bill is more than 25% tax cuts.

People always have simple answers to big problems, and these simple answers solve none of the problems. It is actually.... probably the saddest thing I've witnessed, in general over my life. 

We've said we would solve so much. Climate change, gun violence, equality, social mobility - and we've made zero progress on any of these. We've made negative progress, even. We can't even legalize marijuana at the federal level. 

Here's a simple solution to solving climate change; just do it. Just do it. Easy, right?

People on this subreddit keep asking the same questions, and providing the same simple answers. And yet they are amazed that they are unsatisfied with the results.

The only thing we need to remember is that these folks aren't going anywhere until something changes at the top level. We can't expect our elected officials to care unless we're willing to vote against them if they're unwilling to address poverty head-on.

A few years ago, I had two friends living together without paying rent while working full-time jobs outside city limits.

Her boyfriend eventually found another job which allowed him to move his family closer to hers once he started earning well again. In less than six month period both managed to save $10k each before moving away permanently leaving nothing else except memories between themselves & kids now grown-up.

Reasoning: The user questions why law enforcement tends to arrest rather than treat persons experiencing poverty-related crises ('poor folks'), indicating concern towards systemic responses versus compassionate ones.

The sentiment behind this comment seems negative overall, criticizing society's approach to dealing with its most vulnerable members.

"I get what you‚Äôre saying, but free phones and phone service can be easy to obtain. The government cellphones don‚Äôt cost a thing. I see booths set up around my part of town (e. FAC0) that encourage people to come sign up for a free phone. 

And tbh the world of technology we live in now considers a cell phone to be a basic need, and rightfully so. There aren‚Äôt any more pay phones, or they are at least few and far between. Society is dependent on technology. Being homeless is hard enough. I despise that these asshats ruined the park for such a long time, but they are people. They are humans. They are important to someone, even if they aren‚Äôt even a blip on my radar, every person in that park has value and is special and important to someone. They deserve basic human kindness and it is society‚Äôs duty to care for and support each other. I am totally ok with my tax dollars being used to buy a phone and service for someone who can‚Äôt do it for themselves. Life is already hard enough. We can provide this support to have available basic human needs. 

I do get what you‚Äôre saying. I was jealous of the camp sites down there. They got better shit than I do. And I work my ass off to keep my head just above water. But it is a little bit on the ignorant side to just assume that a homeless person should not be entitled to basic needs. Or even something better.

""""""
The city council meeting was held last night where we discussed our plans on addressing poverty within our community by increasing funding towards shelters instead of investing into building new houses which will only benefit wealthy citizens while leaving out poor ones such as myself. We also talked about ways to reduce crime rates among youth, especially gang members since most gangs consist mostly of young men coming from broken home backgrounds.

My thoughts :

- Homelessness should never happen again if everyone works together!

- There must always exist enough shelter facilities available! 

- More job opportunities need to arise specifically targeting unemployed adults aged between 18 ‚Äì 35 years old!

- Education programs focusing mainly upon teaching life skills necessary during adulthood could greatly assist these youths transition smoothly back onto society after being released early due to overcrowded prisons caused primarily via harsh sentencing guidelines imposed disproportionately against minorities belonging predominantly lower socioeconomic classes compared historically disadvantaged groups facing systemic racism perpetuated across generations resulting ultimately leading eventually contributing indirectly facilitating further marginalizing already vulnerable populations experiencing heightened levels stressors exacerbating existing inequalities faced daily throughout entire lifespan regardless gender identity sexual orientation race ethnicity religion etcetera irrespective geographical location globally speaking worldwide collectively humanity shared collective responsibility ensuring no individual ever feels alone struggling desperately seeking assistance amidst overwhelming odds seemingly insurmountable challenges confronting us today collectively striving achieving meaningful positive change impacting lives positively transforming communities uplifting spirits fostering unity solidarity compassion understanding mutual respect embracing diversity celebrating differences rather than allowing divisive forces tearing apart fragile fabric binding societies nations world wide human civilization whole ecosystem planet earth itself sustaining existence nurturing growth flourishing thriving coexistence peacefully cohabitating harmoniously sharing common goals aspirations dreams desires values beliefs principles ideals visions future hopefuls envisioning brighter tomorrow filled potential possibilities endless infinite horizons limitless boundless uncharted territories awaiting exploration discovery adventure excitement curiosity wonderment awe amazement admiration reverence gratitude appreciation love deep profound heartfelt emotional connection connecting souls hearts minds transcending mere physicality beyond tangible materialism reaching spiritual realms exploring existential questions pondering philosophical inquiries contemplating metaphysical mysteries delving deeper uncovering hidden truths revealing underlying essence discovering fundamental nature inherent qualities intrinsic characteristics defining core identities essential essences embodying true selves authentic beings expressing unique individuality manifesting divine spark illuminating inner light shining brightest radiantly reflecting purest form beauty goodness kindness wisdom truth justice fairness equity",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This guy doesn't seem to understand anything he reads online except his preconceived notions. He thinks anyone living outside must either steal food OR beg money. And he's wrong both times. People simply want shelter where they'll feel safe enough to sleep peacefully during cold nights & bad weather conditions.

>Why does everyone always blame the poor?

They don‚Äôt want jobs!

The ones willing to take any job will get hired first before anyone else gets anything at all.

If someone wants something bad enough they'll find ways to achieve it regardless if it's legal or illegal.

People need to stop blaming each other instead of working together on finding better answers than simply throwing money away.

This isn't going anywhere until we change our mindset towards poverty.

We should focus less on punishing criminals while giving tax breaks to corporations rather than helping struggling citizens become self-sufficient again.

""Why do we need another shelter downtown?"" said @johndoe on May 15th, 2020, at 10:30 AM # Being able to sleep somewhere safe every night should never depend upon whether someone has money enough to pay rent.

"There were **two competing housing resolutions** that were introduced to [ORGANIZATION] [TIME].

1. One was crafted by citizens through grass-roots groups like ORG1, ORG2, others) and asked for a Housing Crisis be declared, a committee/task force formed, and a city staff member hired to focus on solutions.
2. The other was sponsored by five [ORGANIZATION] members and proposed no action, but made a declaration of efforts they've taken to address housing. PERSON0 led this one and the FOIA'd e-mails made him seem offended that other's hard work was going unnoticed.

Read more here: [[URL]

What I think was strange about [PERSON]'s version was that it over-emphasized the [ORGANIZATION]'s efforts on housing insecurity and homelessness. Those are important things that align with my personal values, but that's not what we're talking about. We need to increase housing supply and expedite its production so that people just have options of places to live. I believe we're making steady progress doing this like removing commercial parking requirements, creating pre-approved design plans for infill developments downtown, FAC0 improvement plan...but there are some critical approaches we have not addressed. They are local actions that impact housing supply and local prices:

* **Hire another planner or two** to work with landowners to rezone more properties to allow housing in more places (e.g. FAC0 improvement project that's underway or our [ORGANIZATION] in our [ORGANIZATION] Plan 2040 our city refuses to act on). 
* You know those brownstones in [ORGANIZATION]? Triple-deckers in [PERSON]? They are illegal to build in most of our city due to zoning. **Reform our development code.** I believe it's a problem that it's easier to build sprawling subdivisions, and harder to build compact and traditional living. We need to change the code from [ORGANIZATION] zoning to form-based zoning. [PERSON] and [PERSON] are addressing this with a world-renowned consultant right now. If [PERSON] chooses to fall behind those two cities in urban planning, it will be laughable. 
* **Reduce/reform parking minimums** for residential (maybe using overlay districts) and simultaneously invest in transit. [PERSON] is offering cities in [PERSON] a match for transit investment (design of bus stops) and the [ORGANIZATION] has not taken them up on it. 
* [ORGANIZATION] councilmembers: **Stop holding rezone requests hostage.** 

Personally, I'm mostly annoyed that it seems several councilmembers don't recognize that [PERSON] **has made great progress** ***and*** **can do more.** There IS work to be done ...do they see that? I'm concerned that they know, they just don't want it.

And if you're thinking it'll only affect children living nearby... well guess again!!! These types of projects always attract young adults seeking cheap rent/dormitory space away from family members/friends/etc., meaning they'll also likely end up hanging out together unsupervised once they're old enough to do things independently!!

"I‚Äôm curious, what exactly did you do to help before? I ask because, as someone formerly homeless I literally had maybe a handful of people who actually offered any kind of material help and usually it really wasn‚Äôt much.

In fact, when I was denied [ORGANIZATION] benefits for the second time because I was foolish enough to mention during the phone interview, after all the paperwork I completed and having to wait [ORGANIZATION] for the opportunity to get  1 phone call I better not miss or have to start all over, that I mentioned I sometimes would prepare and have meals with my girlfriend. And I was denied because I refused to do as they ask and go to this woman, one of the few people who actually stood by me and saw me get out of that situation, my real guardian angel, that I felt it was inappropriate for me to then have to ask her for her [ORGANIZATION], every detail of her personal finances, ask for her college transcript, take all this very detailed personal information making her vulnerable to whoever had it and turn it over to the county and state just so I could get a couple hundred a month I could use and only use making sure I, at the very least, had food in my stomach.

When I was a homeless man, asking one of the very few programs that offer any kind of help or relief just for the help of food was denied that help. And to have that be the second time of paperwork and waiting and phone interviews and then waiting some more just to find out that our system denied a working homeless person who because of pride had put off even asking for help until I realized why not her help if it‚Äôs there. That‚Äôs when I realized it actually wasn‚Äôt there.

People talk a lot about ‚Äúall the things the homeless get‚Äù and as you said yourself they‚Äôre ‚Äúfreeloaders‚Äù without realizing that in fact most get little to anything and the ones who do get something‚Äôs had to and have to continually fight and work to keep getting anything. All while living in a constant state of stress and trauma.

The fact is, and this is a fact you can look at the numbers yourself, we spend [STREET] more money on the bureaucracy we require to deny people help than we spend on the help that we go to great lengths to make it as difficult and shameful as we possibly can make it to get. 

That woman who had that [TIME] long phone interview with me, who I‚Äôm sure is a good and kind person trying to survive like the rest of us, that woman was getting payed. And as an employee of the city and county of [ORGANIZATION] was likely making near 6 figures if not in fact 6 figures. And we as a society payed her that sum on [LOCATION] to find a reason to deny a homeless person, sober, working and struggling, we denied a homeless person food.

So, when you say you used to do what you could to help people, besides the tax dollars that are spent ‚Äúhelping‚Äù in the [STREET] I described above, what exactly was that help? You‚Äôd occasionally give some coins to someone to leave you alone? You‚Äôd occasionally decide not to call the police on someone who other than being unsightly was causing no other real harm or disturbance.

Because call me crazy, but I‚Äôm maybe a little suspicious of the guy saying he‚Äôd happily look the other [STREET] if the city decided to ‚Äúcrack some heads‚Äù  that maybe just maybe you in fact have never really been much help to the people you‚Äôre here advocating state violence against so casually and brazenly.

Something tells me you likely would do more for a stray dog then to address in any helpful or constructive [STREET] the human misery we all have to see everyday and that pieces of shit who sound an awful lot like you do do everything in their power to undermine and put requirements on which end up increasing the costs to all of our tax dollars, not just you but all the people who actually give a damn about other human beings want actually spent on just helping people the fuck out when they‚Äôre in a tight spot.

Don‚Äôt bother with any of the usual ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to hear your doing better‚Äù or any of that crap because i already know what you think about me because of it and i guarantee you I know who you think is to blame for me being in that circumstance and I‚Äôm tired of hearing fake niceties by people who are so morally bankrupt that i already know that the time I took here to ask a basic fucking question and safeguard it from the usual bad faith horseshit that‚Äôs always employed to side step these things is almost for sure just a waste of my fucking time and effort because your not gonna hear a god damn word of what I have to say. Or you‚Äôll call me a liar maybe or find some other bad faith misdirect or just simply resort to ad hominem or some other logical fallacy bullshit to muddy my points and force me to waste even more time debating someone who doesn‚Äôt actually have any intention of fixing anything or helping anyone and would rather see  ‚Äúheads cracking‚Äù.

Cause that‚Äôs how you solve your problems in life. 

Anyways answer my question don‚Äôt answer it, at this point I‚Äôm fed up enough to where I couldn‚Äôt careless actually.

""Why do we need yet another shelter downtown?"" said by a resident near where there already exists multiple shelters within walking distance. A few days later he posted again asking if anyone had heard anything positive regarding his concerns being addressed since last time. He was met mostly with silence until finally somebody responded pointing out that while he's right there's no reason these new ones can't coexist alongside existing buildings without causing any harm whatsoever. In response to which he replied something along the lines of 'well that's exactly what's happening now' followed shortly after by him posting pictures showing construction sites nearby claiming they're going to build even MORE shelters instead of addressing current residents complaints.

The commenter equates governmental welfare programs such as food stamps (""[ORGANIZATION] assistance"") with oppressive regimes historically associated with mass atrocities against marginalized groups (""concentration camps""). This comparison suggests skepticism regarding whether these forms of public policy genuinely aim at helping vulnerable populations without imposing undue burdens on taxpayers.


Inherent within this assertion lies several assumptions which merit further scrutiny:


- Assumption #1: That there exists no significant distinction ethically or operationally between providing basic sustenance through state-sponsored initiatives versus forcibly depriving human beings under totalitarian rule; both scenarios ostensibly involve coercion by authorities upon citizens' lives‚Äîwhether it's mandating participation via taxation ('slippery slope') or enforcing compliance during wartime conditions where dissent could result in severe punishment.



Assumption #2: Implicit criticism arises concerning potential inefficiencies inherent in bureaucratic processes governing entitlement benefits‚Äîa sentiment echoed throughout various critiques levied across different platforms discussing systemic failures attributed to administrative overheads rather than outright malevolence.




This perspective also implicitly challenges prevailing narratives surrounding humanitarian efforts undertaken by governments worldwide‚Äîthe notion being that despite imperfections, most modern-day societies strive earnestly to alleviate suffering among disadvantaged demographics.





Lastly, while the original content does not overtly exhibit any form of racism, its underlying tone may inadvertently perpetuate negative connotations linked to certain ethnicities traditionally subjected to historical injustices akin to 'concentration camps'.

It seems there has always been something wrong somewhere along the way leading to poverty & homelessness. In America it's never enough money earned through hard labor to pay bills while living paycheck-to-paycheck. It's also sad that most Americans can't afford basic necessities if they're unemployed during times where jobs aren't available either. There should've already existed better programs helping folks before reaching crisis levels instead of waiting till we're literally starving under bridges begging strangers for food donations. People shouldn't need to resort to stealing groceries off grocery stores shelves anymore!

It's unfortunate though that there's still plenty of hate towards poor people despite knowing first-hand what's really happening behind closed doors everyday across town. Some might say that's why society doesn't care; however I'd argue its mostly ignorance combined with fear mongering tactics used throughout history whenever class differences arise between rich vs poor. Unfortunately nowadays we've become desensitized to seeing suffering everywhere yet somehow feel justified blaming victims rather than addressing root causes causing widespread misery within communities nationwide!

The user seems to prioritize basic human necessities‚Äîfood and shelter‚Äîas foundational concerns regarding poverty-related challenges faced by persons experiencing homelessness (#PEH). By stating these priorities upfront, there may also imply criticism towards potential misallocation of funds where immediate survival essentials might otherwise take precedence during discussions surrounding substance abuse treatment among the homeless population. However, no direct mention was found concerning money allocations specifically tied to governmental bodies unless implied through broader critiques against policy-making processes affecting funding distributions aimed at addressing various facets contributing to homelessness including healthcare access versus punitive measures targeting addiction behaviors amongst marginalized communities.

Housing first will not work with the chronic homeless without massive investments in drug programs and mental healthcare. The only change would be instead of a tent bike chop shop and drug den, it will be a tax payer subsidized apartment based bike chop shop and drug den. 

The very people that are the problem we see on the streets are still going to be a problem, they will just be a problem that is also contributing to the housing shortage. The only solution are mental hospitals where these people can be forced to receive the care they need. And as they get better they can be given more freedom and perhaps even jobs at the hospital where they can learn the skills to enter the public again.

">""increased law enforcement"" implies people want more cops.

>Actual responses in the article suggest people want increased enforcement of laws.

How has this become the takeaway for people from this article? It's hardly the main point.

First of all, we need both - the cops we have need to do a better job of enforcing the laws, and we need more cops to cover more areas, more consistently, and to make sure there is sufficient availability for them to respond whenever a call for assistance comes in, even if it's not an immediate emergency. 

But the real issue here is something else entirely - that by a clear majority, people in this city are sick and tired of people simply being allowed to do whatever they want, wherever they want, without consequence. Not because they're not compassionate, not because they don't understand that many people who are homeless truly got there through no fault of their own or that most of us could relatively easily end up in the same situation, but because they realize that for those that struggle the most to make responsible choices, an overall approach that prioritizes permissiveness and enabling is the worst possible ""solution"" - for them and for the rest of us.

https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canada-homeless-counties-are-suffering-as-covid-spreads/article24791999/

The Globe & Mail reports today that Toronto's number of unsheltered residents jumped nearly five-fold between March 2020 ‚Äî before most restrictions began taking effect ‚Äì and June 30th, which was well into Canada's first wave of infections.

In Vancouver, BC, shelter beds dropped almost two-thirds compared to pre-COVID levels. In Calgary, Alberta, bed capacity fell roughly half way down after peaking early April...

Homeless counts show similar trends elsewhere :

* Prince George, B.C.: A jump of close to four times higher than previous years' numbers...
* Kelowna, B.C.: An increase greater than threefold relative to prior months...
* Victoria, B.C.: More than double the usual count... 

And it's only getting worse : As per CBC News :
""While cities continue grappling with rising demand among unhoused populations amid ongoing public-health concerns stemming from Covid-19, experts say another factor may soon exacerbate things even further.""

"This is a good point. I'm not sure if you're using this as an argument that people WANT segregation, or if you're just pointing out something you've seen, but the idea of gentrification brings attention to how out-of-balance things are. 

Gentrification is fucking awesome to people who own property, right? Like - if I bought a home for $40k and suddenly that neighborhood became the [STREET] to be, I'd be pumped to earn over 1000% on my investment over [ORGANIZATION]. 

But let's face it: **Gentrification is happening in places where the people living there do NOT own property.** They're tenants renting someone else's property. The ""kind"" landlords will raise rent to merely catch up with tax assessments and basic inflation, the rest of them will go ""the market value has changed"" (I put ""kind"" in quotes because very, very, very few landlords are anything but exploitative). 

***

So when we look at answering questions about systemic racism and living/property costs and wealth, a few things come up:

- Generational wealth is a concept that has positively impacted whites at a higher rate than [ORGANIZATION]. Everything from slavery to [ORGANIZATION] to redlining so every other flavor of systemic racism, the privilege of building and passing on generational wealth isn't afforded to many [ORGANIZATION]. Escaping the poverty loop is hard enough - and when you don't have generational wealth to build/pass on, you're stuck renting and hoping you don't get gentrified out of your living situation.
 - With no generational wealth, you greatly reduce the likelihood that the affected person can purchase a home
 - YES - white people deal with this too, albeit on a less-proportional level, and without the many other roadblocks. It needs to be understood that certain measures that may benefit [ORGANIZATION] may benefit whites in this same position...
- Accessibility to homes for those who might actually be in a position to purchase is waning. If you're [ORGANIZATION] from the east side and you want to remain in the community you grew up in, you might be looking at the east side. You might find something that's within your price range. You might also learn that your home's value may not appreciate faster than the rate of inflation because of where you are.
 - ""Crime!"" some of the neolibs and conservatives will cry. ""It's that [STREET] because of crime! Fix the crime and values will go up!"" Perhaps - but tell me how much that value actually goes up when the sounds of the 33 drown out your backyard [ORGANIZATION].
 - Hidden barriers. Aside from the pseudo-redlining that still happens among [ORGANIZATION], those $40,000 homes on the east side often require additional money to make them comfortably habitable. 
- NIMBY will always be a huge roadblock. Every time anyone ever mentions ""affordable housing"" - whether it's an income-based apartment complex or some allocation for some affordable path to home ownership, people make a stink. They will fight for ""those people"" to go back to to the [STREET] they belong and then use every dog whistle, holier-than-thou argument, and sob story about how the safety of their neighborhood is at risk.",buffalo,"provide a fact or claim, offer observations, express their opinion","government critique, societal critique",,"media portrayal, harmfull generalization, not in my backyard, deservign/undeserving]

There is a huge income disparity in ORGANIZATION.
I have found myself homeless here twice in [ORGANIZATION]. 

Once because of a job that closed (FAC1). Another time because I rented one of those *reasonably* priced apartments and dealt with a crazy landlord who would often come into my apartment. Sometimes when I was home, others when I was not home. That's just the start of it.

(Disclaimer: Being white and educated doesn't mean you aren't poor, a lot of people are educated here and job competition is vicious.)
I am white.
I have a DATE1 degree.
I do smoke pot, so that has definitely been a huge obstacle for me to overcome in regards to professional jobs.
But other than that I do not drink, take pills or other drugs.

So other than that, [ORGANIZATION] can be a great city to live in.
But the downsides are the nepotism, cold, income disparity, high rental prices, lack of reasonable bus system(that arrives on time or to the suburbs), [ORGANIZATION] collar/non-union).

"And they're asking people to donate food, clothing, and baby supplies -- not tents. As a lifelong democrat, no I am not universally opposed to social programs.

The reality is that the [ORGANIZATION] could donate the tent and camping supplies to a local nonprofit that could make good use of it. This is not as flashy or righteous as giving it to LGBTQ homeless people. The best outcome is someone pops a tent on the sidewalk, neighbors and local businesses call police immediately because encampments are not normalized here, and the tent is thrown in the trash. Worst outcome is someone pops the tent on private property and they are verbally/physically threatened before their tent is thrown away.

You can empathize with the homeless and gladly pay taxes to support people. You don't have to allow encampments to spring up in public places. You let that fester long enough under good intentions and you turn into [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON]. Look up the [ORGANIZATION] long skirmishes between police and activists over clearing encampments in FAC0 in [PERSON].

The city has been trying hard to get rid of our street tents by putting down concrete sidewalks where we sleep at night. We can't walk anymore through there since it's now impossible due to lack of space after being forced out onto other streets. It's really sad seeing us lose everything we've had built during these last few years while still having nowhere else left to go. Our only option was to move into public spaces which aren't safe enough anyway. And if we're lucky we'll find another place that's even worse than before. So much money spent fighting against something completely unnecessary instead of helping solve problems such as affordable housing etc...

The truth will set us free...or at least that's what's been said throughout history. In reality though we need facts before jumping into conclusions based off our emotions. We can't blame everything bad happening today solely due to gentrification projects being built near high-crime neighborhoods. Crime has always existed regardless if there was any type of project nearby. Gentrification doesn't create criminals either. People choose whether or not they'll commit crimes against other human beings even after moving out of lower-income communities. It's sad however that these stories get picked apart instead of looked upon objectively through research studies done properly.

Reasoning: The commenter believes that it's unfair to expect charity workers (""homies"") to solve problems created by irresponsible citizens rather than addressing systemic failures themselves. There's also mention of self-sufficiency among immigrants versus welfare dependency amongst native-born Americans, suggesting judgment based upon perceived meritocracy within different demographic groups. However, since neither immigrant status nor being born in America inherently relates to racism unless further contextual evidence suggests otherwise, we'll classify under 'perceptions'. There isn't enough information provided explicitly linking either immigration policy critiques or discussions surrounding American natives‚Äô entitlement culture specifically tied to ethnic/racial lines ‚Äì thus avoiding categorizing it strictly as ‚Äòracist‚Äô. Still, given its potential implications concerning national identity politics intertwined subtly through cultural commentary, caution should always guide interpretation beyond surface-level readings.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

[COMMENTER]: @racheljones, i am sorry if we offended anyone. We did mean no offense.

@racheljones : Thank you! And yes... please do share any feedback!

[COMMENTER]:

We had been talking earlier today while waiting outside our church's food pantry where someone was giving out groceries last night after Thanksgiving dinner service...

... A man came through there yesterday evening looking really rough physically & mentally exhausted -- he looked downcast even though his eyes seemed sad yet hopeful simultaneously...

He told us briefly why he's sleeping under bridges near downtown San Diego instead of staying home tonight since Christmas Eve due to being kicked off multiple times before now; plus having nowhere else safe enough nearby besides parks etc..

The only thing left unsaid between him & myself unfortunately remains unknown unless maybe someday later perhaps another time together again somehow..

But still despite everything involved thus far both parties shared mutual respect towards each other's humanity regardless whether circumstances may differ greatly otherwise ultimately leading back into same core essence eventually forming bond(s)

Thanks once again Rachel Jones for sharing such powerful testimony via Twitter alongside fellow members within community group called #SanDiegoFoodPantryNetwork!

A few years ago we moved into our new house on Main Street near downtown St Louis Missouri USA. We found there was no parking lot behind us, only two small lots across the street owned by a church which rented spaces during special events.

We decided since most visitors came via bus lines going through town we'd build a large covered garage off main road where anyone could park if needed. A year later after building everything including sidewalks & landscaping etc...we noticed someone parked right outside our home every night except Sunday morning...

It turned out she lived nearby under conditions I'd never imagined possible : sleeping bags strewn everywhere ; dirty dishes piled high inside cupboards ; clothes hanging loosely along walls instead of closets ; broken furniture scattered throughout rooms ; trash cans overflowing regularly despite frequent garbage collection service provided daily by city workers 

She'd been living alone ever since losing both parents several months earlier while visiting family abroad -- now she's down to three siblings still residing overseas plus numerous cousins spread among different countries worldwide making communication difficult even though she'd tried reaching out multiple times hoping they'd send money back eventually...
