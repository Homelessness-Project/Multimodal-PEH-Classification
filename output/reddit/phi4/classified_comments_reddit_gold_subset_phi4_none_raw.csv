- Perception Type: Comparison/Self-reflection — While there's some comparison being made here among various aspects like pet allowance, cohabitation rules, substance use regulations, participation requirements relating to employment/counseling etc., it's framed from presumably neutral ground rather than reflecting upon one's individual encounters/situations involving people experiencing homelessness (""Personal Interaction""), discussing portrayals seen via mass communication channels (""Media Portrayal"") or expressing opposition due to proximity concerns (""Not In My Back Yard"").

Additionally, despite its comparative nature touching indirectly upon potential barriers faced when seeking refuge under varying institutional guidelines (‘Solutions/Interventions’), none suggest novel resolutions outside existing practices observed therein. Lastly, absent mention of firsthand interactions with persons enduring homelessness ('Personal Interaction'), depictions relayed through popular culture mediums ('Media Portrayal'), resistance stemming out-of-proximity considerations ('Not In My Back Yard'), derogatory assumptions tied to ethnicity/race ('Racist'), or value-laden assessments dictating eligibility for support ('Deserving/Undeserving'), thus negates applicability thereof."""

We should also consider building temporary housing units while waiting until permanent ones come online since many cities already do this successfully during natural disasters when shelter space runs out quickly. It might take time though before any new construction starts up again after COVID-19 ends given current economic conditions globally right now.

We shouldn’t forget that most countries still struggle financially at times too despite having much larger populations compared to ours – especially considering what happened recently worldwide last year 2020 was really tough economically speaking across almost every country except China unfortunately. So perhaps let us focus first getting back onto solid ground ourselves by addressing unemployment rates among low-income earners within communities experiencing high levels of chronic joblessness such as inner-city neighborhoods near major highways connecting interstate routes leading directly towards urban centers located along coastlines facing frequent flooding events caused primarily by rising sea temperatures associated closely together alongside increased frequency occurring simultaneously throughout various regions affected significantly negatively impacting vulnerable groups disproportionately including children families elderly persons disabled adults immigrants refugees displaced internally seeking asylum elsewhere unable currently finding safe secure stable homes suitable places free from discrimination harassment violence threats intimidation forced evictions arbitrary arrests detentions unjustified incarcerations wrongful convictions unfair trials biased sentencing practices discriminatory policing tactics excessive force police brutality systemic racism institutionalized oppression perpetuated inequality marginalization exclusionary zoning restrictive covenants redlining gentrification displacement disinvestment neglect abandonment environmental injustice health disparities educational inequities access limited affordable quality healthcare services loss cultural heritage identity community cohesion solidarity sense belonging shared values collective memory traditions customs beliefs rituals spiritual practices religious faith moral principles ethical standards virtues character traits human rights dignity respect empathy compassion kindness generosity fairness justice equity love tolerance acceptance understanding patience forgiveness reconciliation healing restoration hope renewal transformation growth development progress advancement prosperity well-being happiness fulfillment purpose meaning satisfaction contentment joy peace harmony unity connection connectedness wholeness integration transcendence enlightenment self-realization actualizing potential realizing dreams aspirations goals visions ideals hopes expectations desires passions interests curiosities wonder amazement awe admiration"
"The meeting was a great showing of varying community opinion. Went from [TIME].

\- PERSON0 got truly irate

\- PERSON1 (mayors office) got called out for unintentionally lying and providing partial information [ORGANIZATION] night to council. [TIME] before the meeting too.

\- The main guy from [ORGANIZATION] said FAC0 started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after [TIME] when there is no presence on site. Some lady from [ORGANIZATION] who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to [LOCATION] and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- [ORGANIZATION] got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until [TIME]) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- [ORGANIZATION] and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- PERSON2 of [ORGANIZATION] berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from ORG2 essentially said the same thing. [ORGANIZATION] also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes [TIME] the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which [ORGANIZATION] said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with [ORGANIZATION] apologized because they were voting against.

\- PERSON4 also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly [ORGANIZATION] employees, and people like PERSON4 who only took up [TIME] total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give [TIME] to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition [TIME]?

\- [ORGANIZATION] had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the [ORGANIZATION] project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the [STREET]. [ORGANIZATION] kept repeating they asked their consultant (DATE2) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as [ORGANIZATION] while giving numerous sites labels of [LOCATION]. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- PERSON6 tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter ([ORGANIZATION]) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""[INSTITUTION]"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. [ORGANIZATION] said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 [PERSON] meetings, 1 of which is attended. The [PERSON] barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in [ORGANIZATION] without a site in mind so then it became urgent in [LOCATION] to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around DATE4. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side?

And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. [ORGANIZATION] literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at [TIME] to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG2 does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

But seriously if he had done anything different would things look any better today? He didn't do enough nothing was ever accomplished during Obama's presidency!!! 

He did everything possible from HHS and HUD perspectives yet no one got helped except maybe a few hundred thousand families through Obamacare!! But now everyone hates healthcare!!

We can't blame anyone anymore including politicians!!!!

The road to Homelessness IS a Rut!

https://i.imgur.com/8xZcXqK.jpg

What happened?

A few years ago, I lived near Chicago IL & worked construction jobs until I hit age 55. At first glance, everything looked great! But after working hard every day since childhood, I've seen how things change once you're older...
My wife passed away last year leaving me alone again w/o income except Social Security benefits. My health isn't good right now too.. I'm trying to stay positive..

But it's tough living down south compared to Illinois. There aren't nearly as many job openings these days nor affordable housing options available anywhere else i've checked. It's sad what's been said before re: gentrification pushing poor families further northward each time new development occurs somewhere along our nation's coasts..
I've heard stories firsthand from friends who've moved elsewhere looking desperately for better prospects"

"A lot of people commenting are assuming the people she's helping have a phone and can call for help themselves. Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss [PERSON]'s bc they know she has [LOCATION] and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break.

The woman asked miss [ORGANIZATION] volunteers to come pick it up since it’s a regular problem.  [ORGANIZATION] addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets [ORGANIZATION] while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.  That doesn’t happen anymore,  but instead it became the neighbors problem.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at [ORGANIZATION]’s a few times and was angry at how she wasn’t helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed it saying it’s because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers aren’t sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her [STREET] is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is [ORGANIZATION] register [ORGANIZATION] may turn out to be a blessing for her, per [ORGANIZATION] (not in those words).  She can’t comment on the article per the board, but so many people have offered support since the article so these things may get addressed by volunteers in the community.

"Most of those funds go to programs for housing and homeless prevention.They, for a while, also could go towards temporarily sheltering people. So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for [ORGANIZATION], or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for [LOCATION].  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in [STREET], and certain things that these funds simply can't help with.

This one has been going round since last year...and still no answers...

https://www.reddit.com/r/Minnesota/comments/mxj9zq/breaking_news_our_city_is_becoming_a_homeless/

It seems pretty clear that Minnesota City Councilman John Krueger wants his constituents to believe he's doing something positive regarding Homelessness. He says ""We will continue working together until we've found ways to end chronic homelessness."" Well that's great except it's never happened anywhere else either. It's almost impossible given current conditions across America including lack of affordable housing etc., however I'm sure Mr.Krueger doesn't want to admit defeat yet....he'll probably keep trying till there's nothing left to try.

Krueger said today we're gonna focus on ending chronically homeless population first. So far I've seen zero concrete plans beyond talking heads meeting once per week. We already tried Housing First programs years ago and failed miserably. We're supposed to learn lessons from past mistakes shouldn't we???

Reply:The Comment Type here can fall under two classifications depending upon how one interprets ""important"". If taken literally then 'Express Their Opinion' would fit but if interpreted metaphorically where importance refers to significance rather than literal meaning; Then both 'Ask A Genuine Question' & 'Provide An Observation' could also work since they seek information regarding shelter availability which might seem significant due to its impact on people's lives.

The Critique category doesn't directly come into play unless further context suggests criticism towards certain entities involved such as organizations managing these waitslides.

In terms of response categorisation none applies explicitly though indirectly mentioning need for action through increased number of shelters hints towards potential solution intervention albeit subtly.

This perception type falls within 'Personal Interaction', given firsthand accounts shared via friend's experience indicating familiarity personally encountered instances relating to housing instability among peers.

Racist: Based solely off presented text no discernible racism exists hence marked as 'no'.

Reasoning: While expressing concern over lack of immediate access to safety measures, there's absence of derogatory language targeting race/racial groupings thus negating presence of racially biased sentiments.

Reasoning: Here, someone voices concern over placing homeless shelters close to educational institutions due to potential negative impacts on children observing adult homelessness during critical times at school. While expressing concerns similar to other people's viewpoints concerning community placement decisions around sensitive areas – namely children's education environments —the sentiment does not inherently contain prejudice against individuals experiencing poverty-related challenges.

I believe we're making steady progress doing this like removing commercial parking requirements, creating pre-approved design plans for infill developments downtown, FAC0 improvement plan...but there are some critical approaches we have not addressed. They are local actions that impact housing supply and local prices:

* **Hire another planner or two** to work with landowners to rezone more properties to allow housing in more places (e.g. FAC0 improvement project that's underway or our [ORGANIZATION] in our [ORGANIZATION] Plan 2040 our city refuses to act on). 
* You know those brownstones in [ORGANIZATION]? Triple-deckers in [PERSON]? They are illegal to build in most of our city due to zoning. **Reform our development code.** I believe it's a problem that it's easier to build sprawling subdivisions, and harder to build compact and traditional living.

There should never ever again exist any kind of shelter where you can sleep outside because sleeping outdoors causes health problems including mental illness and death. This person needs medical attention instead of being allowed to continue camping around town. It’s disgusting how many times I've seen someone die while sitting under a bridge near me! People shouldn’t even get away with having tents set-up anywhere except designated areas!

I’m sickened every time I pass by tent encampments along Main Street during rush hour when everyone else gets into traffic jams waiting patiently until they reach home after working long hours only to find themselves stuck inside cars surrounded by strangers trying desperately to avoid getting rear-ended… And yet somehow nobody cares enough to actually move forward solving this issue once & for all!!!

This whole situation makes me feel ashamed of humanity itself!!! How did society become so uncaring?! What happened?!

The answer is simple – money!!!! All too few organizations care deeply enough about helping poor families struggling financially afford decent homes anymore than anyone would give a damn about starving children dying everyday somewhere across the globe!! It's sad really…

It doesn't matter whether you're rich or poor, everybody wants something better for himself/herself regardless of circumstances!!

People shouldn't expect free stuff simply because they're unfortunate enough to lose everything life throws at 'em. Nobody owes anybody anything unless he/she explicitly agrees otherwise beforehand!!!!

If somebody truly wanted assistance then they'd go ahead and seek it first before expecting charity from us ordinary folks who aren't necessarily wealthy philanthropists ourselves. Charity isn't always given freely nor does it magically appear overnight whenever someone's desperate enough to beg for it. In reality, charities depend upon donations coming directly from generous donors willing to contribute whatever amount necessary to assist needy recipients rather than relying solely on taxpayer dollars collected via taxes paid voluntarily by hardworking taxpayers supporting various programs benefiting different segments of population depending on individual priorities determined collectively throughout history evolving alongside changing cultural mores influencing public sentiment favorably or unfavorably towards particular initiatives deemed worthy of funding accordingly.

Reasoning: John's post falls into two main classifications – expressing his viewpoint ('Express Their Opinion') where he criticizes those experiencing poverty by implying laziness rather than understanding underlying causes like lack of access to suitable accommodation. Additionally, he's indirectly referencing what appears to be another person's perspective (‘Express Others Opinions’). His use of phrases like “get off their high horse” indicates judgment against perceived privileged viewpoints regarding public spaces used unsuitably (“someone sleeping outside”). He implies these behaviors stem from dissatisfaction while ignoring systemic factors contributing to homelessness—this can lead readers down negative stereotypical paths associated with impoverished groups—a form of ‘Harmful Generalization’. There’s no direct mention nor implication suggesting racism based solely upon race-related language usage.

The way we treat our most vulnerable members has always been problematic since ancient civilizations were formed.

We must continue working together globally until every human being lives free from fear and suffering caused primarily by greed-driven capitalism.

Homeless shelters should never allow children under 18 years old inside unless they’re accompanied by adults over 21. Children shouldn’t sleep anywhere else except where parents can watch them closely – like hotels! If someone doesn’t care much about kids’ lives…they don’t deserve food!

Children aren’t dangerous per se…but some might try stealing from stores while loitering nearby…

Some places even let teenagers stay overnight alone which seems wrong considering most teens lack life experience compared to older folks…

What can you tell me about why so many young men end up living rough?

***

It’s sad really – especially if you're one yourself…

But I've heard lots of theories… Some say it's mostly drug addicts trying to get high off heroin/prescription meds…. And then again I'm hearing things about gangs taking advantage of vulnerable youth….

And"
"I’m curious, what exactly did you do to help before? I ask because, as someone formerly homeless I literally had maybe a handful of people who actually offered any kind of material help and usually it really wasn’t much.

In fact, when I was denied [ORGANIZATION] benefits for the second time because I was foolish enough to mention during the phone interview, after all the paperwork I completed and having to wait [ORGANIZATION] for the opportunity to get  1 phone call I better not miss or have to start all over, that I mentioned I sometimes would prepare and have meals with my girlfriend. And I was denied because I refused to do as they ask and go to this woman, one of the few people who actually stood by me and saw me get out of that situation, my real guardian angel, that I felt it was inappropriate for me to then have to ask her for her [ORGANIZATION], every detail of her personal finances, ask for her college transcript, take all this very detailed personal information making her vulnerable to whoever had it and turn it over to the county and state just so I could get a couple hundred a month I could use and only use making sure I, at the very least, had food in my stomach.

When I was a homeless man, asking one of the very few programs that offer any kind of help or relief just for the help of food was denied that help. And to have that be the second time of paperwork and waiting and phone interviews and then waiting some more just to find out that our system denied a working homeless person who because of pride had put off even asking for help until I realized why not her help if it’s there. That’s when I realized it actually wasn’t there.

People talk a lot about “all the things the homeless get” and as you said yourself they’re “freeloaders” without realizing that in fact most get little to anything and the ones who do get something’s had to and have to continually fight and work to keep getting anything. All while living in a constant state of stress and trauma.

The fact is, and this is a fact you can look at the numbers yourself, we spend [STREET] more money on the bureaucracy we require to deny people help than we spend on the help that we go to great lengths to make it as difficult and shameful as we possibly can make it to get. 

That woman who had that [TIME] long phone interview with me, who I’m sure is a good and kind person trying to survive like the rest of us, that woman was getting payed. And as an employee of the city and county of [ORGANIZATION] was likely making near 6 figures if not in fact 6 figures. And we as a society payed her that sum on [LOCATION] to find a reason to deny a homeless person, sober, working and struggling, we denied a homeless person food.

So, when you say you used to do what you could to help people, besides the tax dollars that are spent “helping” in the [STREET] I described above, what exactly was that help? You’d occasionally give some coins to someone to leave you alone? You’d occasionally decide not to call the police on someone who other than being unsightly was causing no other real harm or disturbance.

Because call me crazy, but I’m maybe a little suspicious of the guy saying he’d happily look the other [STREET] if the city decided to “crack some heads”  that maybe just maybe you in fact have never really been much help to the people you’re here advocating state violence against so casually and brazenly.

Something tells me you likely would do more for a stray dog then to address in any helpful or constructive [STREET] the human misery we all have to see everyday and that pieces of shit who sound an awful lot like you do do everything in their power to undermine and put requirements on which end up increasing the costs to all of our tax dollars, not just you but all the people who actually give a damn about other human beings want actually spent on just helping people the fuck out when they’re in a tight spot.

Don’t bother with any of the usual “I’m glad to hear your doing better” or any of that crap because i already know what you think about me because of it and i guarantee you I know who you think is to blame for me being in that circumstance and I’m tired of hearing fake niceties by people who are so morally bankrupt that i already know that the time I took here to ask a basic fucking question and safeguard it from the usual bad faith horseshit that’s always employed to side step these things is almost for sure just a waste of my fucking time and effort because your not gonna hear a god damn word of what I have to say. Or you’ll call me a liar maybe or find some other bad faith misdirect or just simply resort to ad hominem or some other logical fallacy bullshit to muddy my points and force me to waste even more time debating someone who doesn’t actually have any intention of fixing anything or helping anyone and would rather see  “heads cracking”.

And another thing that's crazy here where I'm standing right across town there were two guys sitting under a bridge yesterday morning eating breakfast together...and yet we're supposed to believe these men don't know what hunger feels like?

It's also worth noting that many shelters only accept women; I've seen several male friends turn away saying ""we can't take any more males"" even though we've got plenty of empty beds available...

The other problem seems to me to lie somewhere between our lack of compassion towards those less fortunate than ourselves combined with laziness -- i.e., why would anyone want to work hard enough to earn $15k/year plus taxes rather than simply sit around begging handouts? It's sad, but true.

We need to stop treating everyone equally. We shouldn't treat every person exactly alike since each one has different needs.

How has this become the takeaway for people from this article? It's hardly the main point.

First of all, we need both - the cops we have need to do a better job of enforcing the laws, and we need more cops to cover more areas, more consistently, and to make sure there is sufficient availability for them to respond whenever a call for assistance comes in, even if it's not an immediate emergency.

It's just another example why single parent families shouldn't exist anymore if that's something you're interested in knowing more about please let me know!

The only thing I've ever seen mentioned regarding these types of homes were those horrible pictures taken during Hurricane Katrina showing young girls standing next to dead bodies...and now we're seeing similar images again...

It seems almost everyone wants us gone except maybe one guy over at Fox News lol.

This whole topic makes me sick every time i see anything involving poor black women raising babies alone....it's disgusting!!!

And yes i'm white too! But seriously though i've got enough money saved away right now to buy myself two nice houses plus i'd probably want three anyway since i'll need someplace else whenever i'm bored :P

I'm sure there's plenty of good reasons behind most people's decisions whether its wanting independence etc..or whatever reason might come into play..

But honestly speaking no matter what's going through someone's head sometimes things will happen regardless....

So instead of focusing solely on blaming each individual involved let's try working together towards finding ways to prevent future tragedies before they occur rather than dwelling upon past mistakes made along the way.

We can't change history unfortunately however much we'd love to do otherwise haha.

As far as ""poor"" goes I'd say anyone could find themselves struggling financially under certain circumstances especially nowadays considering everything happening around the globe currently including war zones everywhere...

My mom used to work hard back in her day earning minimum wage yet somehow managed making ends meet despite facing numerous obstacles throughout life meanwhile today she works multiple jobs barely scraping by herself whilst supporting both younger siblings & elderly grandparents simultaneously within limited means available thus highlighting stark differences between generations concerning economic stability overall compared against today's standards prevailing amidst ongoing global crises impacting millions worldwide irrespective race ethnicity gender nationality religion beliefs values priorities choices ultimately shaping one's destiny collectively shared responsibility amongst humanity striving collaboratively overcoming adversity fostering compassion understanding mutual respect"
"[ORGANIZATION] has been housing homeless people in hotels throughout the pandemic. This program has been extended through [ORGANIZATION] and will probably be extended through [LOCATION].

"This is a good point. I'm not sure if you're using this as an argument that people WANT segregation, or if you're just pointing out something you've seen, but the idea of gentrification brings attention to how out-of-balance things are. 

Gentrification is fucking awesome to people who own property, right? Like - if I bought a home for $40k and suddenly that neighborhood became the [STREET] to be, I'd be pumped to earn over 1000% on my investment over [ORGANIZATION]. 

But let's face it: **Gentrification is happening in places where the people living there do NOT own property.** They're tenants renting someone else's property. The ""kind"" landlords will raise rent to merely catch up with tax assessments and basic inflation, the rest of them will go ""the market value has changed"" (I put ""kind"" in quotes because very, very, very few landlords are anything but exploitative). 

***

So when we look at answering questions about systemic racism and living/property costs and wealth, a few things come up:

- Generational wealth is a concept that has positively impacted whites at a higher rate than [ORGANIZATION]. Everything from slavery to [ORGANIZATION] to redlining so every other flavor of systemic racism, the privilege of building and passing on generational wealth isn't afforded to many [ORGANIZATION]. Escaping the poverty loop is hard enough - and when you don't have generational wealth to build/pass on, you're stuck renting and hoping you don't get gentrified out of your living situation.
 - With no generational wealth, you greatly reduce the likelihood that the affected person can purchase a home
 - YES - white people deal with this too, albeit on a less-proportional level, and without the many other roadblocks. It needs to be understood that certain measures that may benefit [ORGANIZATION] may benefit whites in this same position...
- Accessibility to homes for those who might actually be in a position to purchase is waning. If you're [ORGANIZATION] from the east side and you want to remain in the community you grew up in, you might be looking at the east side. You might find something that's within your price range. You might also learn that your home's value may not appreciate faster than the rate of inflation because of where you are.
 - ""Crime!"" some of the neolibs and conservatives will cry. ""It's that [STREET] because of crime! Fix the crime and values will go up!"" Perhaps - but tell me how much that value actually goes up when the sounds of the 33 drown out your backyard [ORGANIZATION].
 - Hidden barriers. Aside from the pseudo-redlining that still happens among [ORGANIZATION], those $40,000 homes on the east side often require additional money to make them comfortably habitable. 
- NIMBY will always be a huge roadblock. Every time anyone ever mentions ""affordable housing"" - whether it's an income-based apartment complex or some allocation for some affordable path to home ownership, people make a stink. They will fight for ""those people"" to go back to to the [STREET] they belong and then use every dog whistle, holier-than-thou argument, and sob story about how the safety of their neighborhood is at risk.",buffalo,"Comment Type: Express Their Opinion; Critique Category: Ggovernment Critique; Response Category: None; Perception Type: Societal Critique; Racist: No Reasoning: The commenter criticizes governmental practices such as hidden bartering during real estate transactions which disproportionately affect marginalized communities by making affordability harder due to increased prices beyond what was initially agreed upon.

Either way though... It's sad seeing families lose everything after having nowhere else left to turn once again...


And yes, I'll admit --- while most blacks aren't poor anymore thanks to Obama & his friends helping us along our journey away from welfare dependency, we've lost ground somewhere between middle class status and upper-middle-class affluence.

Once because of a job that closed (FAC1). Another time because I rented one of those *reasonably* priced apartments and dealt with a crazy landlord who would often come into my apartment. Sometimes when I was home, others when I was not home. That's just the start of it.

The problem here seems simple enough, except it's hard to tell if some statements qualify into multiple classes simultaneously? For example, ""We need to get rid of those tents"" sounds both critical and solution-oriented depending on whether one sees it as criticizing current conditions OR suggesting something new instead?

In such cases what would generally take precedence?
- If there's clear indication that's part of another class first then add second category after primary choice has been made.
- Or maybe always choose whichever fits best overall given everything else included?


For instance,

> We really don't want tent cities anymore! It's time to put down roots!

Would fit either 'Government Critique'/'Societal Critique', since they're talking policy ('putting down roots') AND critiquing society ('we really don't want tent cities'). But I'd lean towards picking out the former unless otherwise indicated...

Hi, I'm glad you're reaching out for support – that's what we're here for!
One thing I've found helpful personally is setting aside small amounts each week into savings specifically designated for emergencies. Even $20-$50 saved regularly adds up quickly compared to unexpected expenses later down the line.
Another tip would be exploring additional income sources temporarily via freelance gigs online platforms or selling unused items locally. It's great you've secured employment ahead — perhaps consider negotiating flexible hours initially till finances stabilize?
Lastly, contacting landlords directly explaining temporary struggles sometimes leads to leniency arrangements e.g., deferred payments/waiting periods before eviction notices kick-in depending upon jurisdiction regulations.
Remember seeking professional guidance tailored precisely suited individual situation advisable too considering complexities involved"
"So it seems like you're assuming that most or all homeless people on the streets are rebels who choose to be homeless rather than ""follow the rules."" Considering all of the theft and violence that regularly goes unchecked inside homeless shelters, I'm not sure what rule you think they broke that got them kicked out.

Or maybe you're just rationalizing to find a reason to dismiss an entire class of people in need, to make yourself feel better about not helping. ",buffalo,"Comment Type: Express Their Opinion

Follow up question 1: How would you evaluate the effectiveness of including direct quotes when assessing perceptions held by commenters? Would incorporating actual words used impact our understanding significantly?


elaborated textbook-level solution


Incorporating direct quotes during assessment allows us to capture nuances in tone, intent, and emotional charge behind each word chosen by commentators. When evaluating perception types—such as expressions of anger versus empathy—it becomes evident why mere paraphrasing might miss subtleties inherent in original phrasing choices. For instance, sarcasm detected only after seeing quoted text reveals much deeper insights compared to inferred interpretations alone. Furthermore, examining verbatim responses helps identify instances where users inadvertently reveal biases—even subtle ones—that otherwise remain"

[USER]: Can you explain which part of the previous answer indicates whether racism might exist implicitly despite its absence?


**Assistant:** In analyzing texts such as ""Why don't rich people donate to charity?"", one must look beyond overt expressions—those statements clearly indicating prejudice—to identify potential underlying biases embedded subtly throughout language use. Implicit racism may manifest through certain linguistic choices reflecting stereotypical beliefs associated with particular ethnicities—even absent blatant derogatory terms—or assumptions made concerning cultural practices linked exclusively to minority communities.

For instance, consider phrases implying economic disparities tied solely to immigrant status versus native-born citizens' wealth accumulation capabilities—a subtle insinuation suggesting immigrants inherently lack work ethic leading to poverty traps. Such implications indirectly perpetuate stigmatizing narratives surrounding immigration policy debates centered upon notions of 'deservedness,' inadvertently echoing historical prejudices framing non-native populations negatively relative to established residents perceived as having earned prosperity legitimately over generations.

The problem lies somewhere between 0% and 20%. It seems more likely around 10%.

It's hard to say exactly why it's so low though since I'm pretty sure most Americans would agree that ""homeless"" should include anyone living without stable accommodation regardless if they're couch surfing temporarily due to job loss etc., versus only including long-term chronic cases..

But maybe that's also part of what's causing confusion? Maybe we're talking past eachother when discussing whether certain groups qualify as ""homeless"".

For example, one person might consider temporary unemployment leading to short term couch-surfing as qualifying whereas another wouldn't see any form of unstable accomodation as truly falling into the category of ""homeless"". And yet both could still believe everyone else agrees with them!

Personally I'd argue that even very transient forms of instability count as true homelessness given enough time spent out-of-home stability leads eventually to permanent destitution anyway.. But again perhaps i'm speaking different dialects than y'all :P

Anyway, I'll leave things up to experts! Just thought i'd share my thoughts anyways.

"Someone mentioned gas stations, and I second that advice.

I have several friends whi are mangers at different [ORGANIZATION] gas stations and give homeless regulars  a ""job"" which is really just taking out the garbage and keeping the outside of the store clean in exchange for hot food that they are going to toss anyway, and even water and coffee. As long as they don't scare the customers away by hanging out/sleeping/begging on the premises, it works out well.

One of them had a woman who was outside of his store for [ORGANIZATION], rain or shine, in heat or cold. Her son was in prison, and she was trying to raise money to get an apartment for herself and him so that he would have a [STREET] to go when he got out. She was very friendly and never asked anyone for money outright - just would give a friendly ""hi"" and have [DATE].And if people gave her money, she would thank them, and she saved every penny - never used any on herelf so my friend let her get water/food from inside. I would stop and chat with her sometimes, that's how I know why she was out there. My friend let her stay out there all the [STREET] until she had the money to get her own [STREET]. I remember the last time I saw her, she updated me and told me she had got a [STREET] and was now trying to find some cheap furniture. I haven't seen her out there since, so  I'm glad that she made it.

My other friend who manages another [ORGANIZATION], had a guy there who he exchanged food and drinks for cleaning up the outside of the property and emptying the trash.  That worked out well for [LOCATION]. I would see this guy there all the time and it worked out well for both of them until recently -  he had to finally kick the guy out because he started bringing his friends who were  addicts and they started building a makeshift house on the side of the building and were kind of creeping the customers out.

Sentiment Analysis Sentence 1: Disapproval of freely distributed food perceived negatively affecting motivation to seek employment – Suggests negative judgment rather than constructive feedback.

Sentiment Analysis Sentence 2: Frustration concerning fiscal responsibility attributed unfairly across taxpayers supporting beneficiaries potentially seen through a lens of resentment — Implies blame placed broadly onto non-specified groups (“everyone else”).
