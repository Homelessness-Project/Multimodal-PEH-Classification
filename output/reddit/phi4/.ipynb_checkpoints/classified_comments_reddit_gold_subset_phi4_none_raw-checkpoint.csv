- Perception Type: Comparison/Self-reflection — While there's some comparison being made here among various aspects like pet allowance, cohabitation rules, substance use regulations, participation requirements relating to employment/counseling etc., it's framed from presumably neutral ground rather than reflecting upon one's individual encounters/situations involving people experiencing homelessness (""Personal Interaction""), discussing portrayals seen via mass communication channels (""Media Portrayal"") or expressing opposition due to proximity concerns (""Not In My Back Yard"").

Additionally, despite its comparative nature touching indirectly upon potential barriers faced when seeking refuge under varying institutional guidelines (‘Solutions/Interventions’), none suggest novel resolutions outside existing practices observed therein. Lastly, absent mention of firsthand interactions with persons enduring homelessness ('Personal Interaction'), depictions relayed through popular culture mediums ('Media Portrayal'), resistance stemming out-of-proximity considerations ('Not In My Back Yard'), derogatory assumptions tied to ethnicity/race ('Racist'), or value-laden assessments dictating eligibility for support ('Deserving/Undeserving'), thus negates applicability thereof."""

We should also consider building temporary housing units while waiting until permanent ones come online since many cities already do this successfully during natural disasters when shelter space runs out quickly. It might take time though before any new construction starts up again after COVID-19 ends given current economic conditions globally right now.

We shouldn’t forget that most countries still struggle financially at times too despite having much larger populations compared to ours – especially considering what happened recently worldwide last year 2020 was really tough economically speaking across almost every country except China unfortunately. So perhaps let us focus first getting back onto solid ground ourselves by addressing unemployment rates among low-income earners within communities experiencing high levels of chronic joblessness such as inner-city neighborhoods near major highways connecting interstate routes leading directly towards urban centers located along coastlines facing frequent flooding events caused primarily by rising sea temperatures associated closely together alongside increased frequency occurring simultaneously throughout various regions affected significantly negatively impacting vulnerable groups disproportionately including children families elderly persons disabled adults immigrants refugees displaced internally seeking asylum elsewhere unable currently finding safe secure stable homes suitable places free from discrimination harassment violence threats intimidation forced evictions arbitrary arrests detentions unjustified incarcerations wrongful convictions unfair trials biased sentencing practices discriminatory policing tactics excessive force police brutality systemic racism institutionalized oppression perpetuated inequality marginalization exclusionary zoning restrictive covenants redlining gentrification displacement disinvestment neglect abandonment environmental injustice health disparities educational inequities access limited affordable quality healthcare services loss cultural heritage identity community cohesion solidarity sense belonging shared values collective memory traditions customs beliefs rituals spiritual practices religious faith moral principles ethical standards virtues character traits human rights dignity respect empathy compassion kindness generosity fairness justice equity love tolerance acceptance understanding patience forgiveness reconciliation healing restoration hope renewal transformation growth development progress advancement prosperity well-being happiness fulfillment purpose meaning satisfaction contentment joy peace harmony unity connection connectedness wholeness integration transcendence enlightenment self-realization actualizing potential realizing dreams aspirations goals visions ideals hopes expectations desires passions interests curiosities wonder amazement awe admiration"
"The meeting was a great showing of varying community opinion. Went from [TIME].

\- PERSON0 got truly irate

\- PERSON1 (mayors office) got called out for unintentionally lying and providing partial information [ORGANIZATION] night to council. [TIME] before the meeting too.

\- The main guy from [ORGANIZATION] said FAC0 started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after [TIME] when there is no presence on site. Some lady from [ORGANIZATION] who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to [LOCATION] and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- [ORGANIZATION] got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until [TIME]) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- [ORGANIZATION] and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- PERSON2 of [ORGANIZATION] berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from ORG2 essentially said the same thing. [ORGANIZATION] also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes [TIME] the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which [ORGANIZATION] said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with [ORGANIZATION] apologized because they were voting against.

\- PERSON4 also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly [ORGANIZATION] employees, and people like PERSON4 who only took up [TIME] total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give [TIME] to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition [TIME]?

\- [ORGANIZATION] had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the [ORGANIZATION] project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the [STREET]. [ORGANIZATION] kept repeating they asked their consultant (DATE2) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as [ORGANIZATION] while giving numerous sites labels of [LOCATION]. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- PERSON6 tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter ([ORGANIZATION]) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""[INSTITUTION]"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. [ORGANIZATION] said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 [PERSON] meetings, 1 of which is attended. The [PERSON] barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in [ORGANIZATION] without a site in mind so then it became urgent in [LOCATION] to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around DATE4. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side?

I am just saying I do believe you should always give first priority to helping yourself before trying to fix other people's problems... If you're going through something hard like being poor/homeless etc.. You need to take responsibility for getting out of whatever situation you've gotten yourselves into.... And if that's really too much trouble maybe try asking God why he made us human beings? Or even better go back to Eden!

As for condoms and needle exchange, there's only one other program and it just came to the GPE0/Boone county DATE2, [PERSON]. And they are another [ORGANIZATION] send. 
[PERSON] has a battered women's program, beds are full.
