Less investment in real estate will result in less housing, and less housing will result in even more homelessness a vicious cycle. Its time for true compassion and a common-sense approach to the problem. First, its not OK for people to live on the streets. Its not compassionate to the homeless and its not fair to the taxpayer. Scrap the stupid laws advocating for living on the streets, construct shelters, and bring the homeless in for safe and humane housing on a temporary basis. Second, provide effective care for the mentally ill and drug-addicted members of the homeless population, which makes up a majority. Allowing them to exist as they are, living on the streets as they deal with their challenges being untreated, is wrong its cruel. Help the addicted to get clean, help the sick to get well, and use a proper approach for those who can do neither. Finally, stop being so hostile to corporations and partner with them to employ the homeless. Work with businesses, dont just tax them.

"For instance, if I come across a park bench that is protected from rain by some natural or man-made structure, I might determine that the bench would be an acceptable [STREET] to hunker down, at least temporarily.

The rate of homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] increased by 2.7 from DATE2 through [ORGANIZATION], in spite of record-low unemployment rates and a roaring economy nationwide. So why the increase?

Reasoning: The comment provides factual claims about homelessness reduction and rent increases, and expresses the opinion that ""conventional wisdom"" is incorrect.

There is no racial bias present."
"In [ORGANIZATION], the numbers from the [ORGANIZATION] metropolitan area provide more evidence for the enforcement hypothesis. According to data from the City of [ORGANIZATION], an astonishing 51 percent of the homeless migrated to the city after becoming homeless somewhere else. By the conventional wisdomâs middle-class logic, this would be an irrational choice an individual with no shelter or stable source of income would not move to one of the nationâs most expensive cities. But again, the homeless operate under a different set of assumptions and incentives. They are strongly motivated to move to the most permissive environment. In a research survey of homeless migrants to [ORGANIZATION], 15 percent said that they came to access homeless services, 10 percent came for legal marijuana, and 16 percent were transients who were âœtraveling or visitingâ when they decided to set up camp. These responses may obscure the largest incentive of all the de facto legalization of [STREET] camping, drug consumption, and property crime. As former [ORGANIZATION] public safety advisor [ORGANIZATION] has shown, the city is now home to a large population of homeless âœprolific offendersâ who commit property crimes to feed their addictionsâand are rarely held to account by the criminal-justice system.",san francisco,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions]

It critiques government approaches and implies societal issues regarding where homeless people are ""pushed."" The statement ""If I was a homeless person inclined to do drugs and commit crimes..."" generalizes PEH as likely to commit crimes and use drugs, which is a harmful generalization.

"This understanding has three moral blind spots.

[ORGANIZATION] progressives have sought to decriminalize public camping, drug consumption, and property crimes because they view authority as the problem, not part of the solution. Second, because progressives discount the moral foundation of purity, they overlook and excuse the filth associated with [STREET] camping. Homeless encampments have proved to be havens for trash, needles, drugs, human waste, and infectious diseases, yet [ORGANIZATION] progressives have fought to âœstop the sweepsâ of tent cities and filed lawsuits against encampment cleanups. They prioritize âœcare for our curbside neighborsâ over sanitation, cleanliness, and public-health concerns. Third, because progressives discount in-group loyalty, they do not see a significant homeless influx as a problem. They tend to make no distinction between the local and nonlocal homeless population and reject concerns about cities becoming magnets for homeless migrants as âœxenophobicâ and âœhomeless-hating.â Put simply, progressive cities have adopted a philosophy of all compassion and no enforcement that creates a cycle of permissiveness, enablement, and disorder.",san francisco,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, express their opinion, express others opinions]

Some progressive leaders have complained that enforcement policies shift the burden of homelessness onto the largest cities. But [ORGANIZATION] is the nationâs fourth-largest city.

And on [ORGANIZATION], the city announced it was turning to its beloved4 [ORGANIZATION] facilities, originally built in [LOCATION] for [ORGANIZATION], to house up to 162 people.

Neither [ORGANIZATION] nor the [PERSON] will be used for homeless moved from other shelters, [ORGANIZATION], director of [ORGANIZATION]s ORG2, told [ORGANIZATION], physical distancing in the shelters will be achieved by moving vulnerable individuals from shelter into hotel rooms. FAC0 will still be used to house members of the citys homeless population, but no more than 200 at a time, as the [ORGANIZATION] ORG66 reports. The center will house those exiting rooms used for self-isolation and who have tested negative for the disease or are recovering and have tested negative, according to [ORGANIZATION] of plans means that officials now need more rooms, roughly 1,0008 more than were originally projected according to the ORG6.

The person was taken for self-isolation in a hotel room and is in good condition. The city has turned to the thousands of unoccupied hotel rooms in [ORGANIZATION] as priority housing sites for healthcare workers, first repsonders, and those who are homeless who need to self-isolate. The citys travel and tourism industries have taken a hit amid the coronavirus pandemic, and hotels have offered more than 11,000 rooms4 for that purpose.

"The order directs the regions estimated 6.7 million residents to remain indoors as much as possible and to only venture outside for essential needs.

A few options for [ORGANIZATION], as The [ORGANIZATION] ORG23 reports, could be to use the citys churches, state-owned facilities, and closed school campuses.

"before you can solve a problem, you have to know what the problem is. And, when it comes to addressing homelessness, theres a lot the general public could do well to know. Some of the most resonant words spoken during the [ORGANIZATION] affair were also some of the first. On the [LOCATION] opening panel, [ORGANIZATION], a [ORGANIZATION] professor and a doctor at [ORGANIZATION], said that even the basic [STREET] we categorize homeless people is wrong and dehumanizing. There is no such thing in my mind as a homeless person, she said. There are people who experience this. [PERSON], in other words, is not an identity. Its an experience  a phrase that resonated with ORG2 in particular. And the doctor knows the culprit for this experience. Look, I love medical conditions, she said. But homelessness is caused by a lack of affordable housing. That statement hit home for [PERSON], the executive director of [ORGANIZATION], who was himself homeless in [DATE]. There are ways to help homeless people in drips and drops  he has committed his life to this  but fully addressing the situation would require a remaking of society. Putting Money in the Right HandsThe money to solve homelessness is there, he continued. Its just not in the hands it needs to be in. Five corporations in [ORGANIZATION] made almost 28 billion in profits [ORGANIZATION], he said. Thats [ADDRESS], in three-and-a-half [LOCATION], they make as much profit as we spend on homelessness. The primary source of affordable housing for minorities is now incarceration, he continued. This is unsustainable. We cannot have a society and culture that is sustainable given this obscene level of wealth inequity. During a discussion with people experiencing homelessness, organized by [LOCATION], [ORGANIZATION] shared her journey from living the life in [PERSON] to a tent encampment on [ORGANIZATION]. A retired firefighter who was injured in a blaze, she said she went from being the wife of an attorney, driving an [ORGANIZATION] and spending my money, to fixing bicycles on the sidewalk. There was a divorce. There was a spree of couch-surfing. There was that horrific moment when all the money was gone and she had nowhere to go and no idea what to do. There is, she said, no manual for being homeless. But nothing was so hurtful as DATE5 a woman walked out into oncoming traffic rather than share the sidewalk with PERSON3. She offered a wry grin, but it was not funny Its not like Im going to bite you and give you homelessness. I am a strong, smart, educated woman.

The new system intends to track thehealth, housing, jail, and counseling history of every homeless person in the city. Its a far cry from the old method, which spanned 15 different databases across multiple agencies. This allowed homeless residents to slip through the cracks, with people who might be registered in one system left out of others. The new solution known asONE System Online Navigation and Entry System aggregates this data into a singleplatform. As part of the test process, the city solicited feedback fromvolunteer consultants at [ORGANIZATION] and other tech companies. The final product allows homeless outreach professionals to log in to an app and view the state of homelessness in the city in real time. But first, it requiresindividuals to be registered at shelters or one of the citys two walk-in centers, which are run by [ORGANIZATION]. Upon registration, homeless residents are asked 17 questions that relate to their history of care and future needs.

"DATE0 before my visit, FAC0 was where [ORGANIZATION] strained to restore its reputation. On the heels of the news of the [ORGANIZATION] conventions move to [PERSON], Mayor [PERSON] declared that [ORGANIZATION] is a world class city and pledged further steps to address homelessness. Yet as the Chronicles Matier noted19, [ORGANIZATION] comments in FAC0 came at the same time that an image of a man with his pants around his knees defecating in a [ORGANIZATION] FAC1 aisle was rocketing around the internet and TV. For [ORGANIZATION], the [ORGANIZATION] convention wasnt even the first blow. In [LOCATION], tourism and convention bureau [ORGANIZATION] announced that a medical association, never named, was looking for another location for its conferences after DATE2, despite holding the gatherings in the city since [ORGANIZATION]. Postconvention surveys showed their members were afraid to walk amid the open drug use, threatening behavior and mental illness that are common on the streets, reports20 the [ORGANIZATION] Chronicle. I see a couple of homeless people around FAC0, but nothing unusual for an urban area. The FAC0 neighborhood effectively borders the [ORGANIZATION], however, meaning a confused tourist could easily end up there.5. ORG3 lunchtime, I pop into a church one with the glorious architecture, high ceilings, and impressive art characteristic of so many older Catholic churches in GPE2. As the churchs bells chime, the sound of a vigorous snorer fills the lulls in between. FAC2, in the [ORGANIZATION] neighborhood, allows the homeless to sleep in the pews DATE4 through a nonprofit program called [ORGANIZATION]. Around since [PERSON], the parish originally was the religious home of Germans in the city. The current church was built in [ORGANIZATION], and although it escaped the [ORGANIZATION] earthquake, it was ravaged by the subsequent fires. Rebuilding was completed in [LOCATION]. [ORGANIZATION] uses the back two-thirds of the sanctuary the church uses the front one-third to celebrate the DATE9 Mass, the program states on its website21. This sends a powerful message to our unhoused neighbors they are in essence part of the community, not to be kicked out when those with homes come in to worship. It also sends a message to those attending Mass the community includes the tired, the poor, those with mental health issues and those who are wet, cold and dirty. [LOCATION]0 I arrive at [PERSON], the front of the church glitters with [LOCATION]1 decorations. During the [ORGANIZATION] service there isnt a Mass [LOCATION]2 the church is mostly quiet. During one brief moment, someone starts babbling, only to be told to be quiet by others. When I look back, I dont see any of the homeless people actively participating in the religious rites. After the service, I explore the rest of the church. Most of the wooden pews with no padding for comfort are occupied by a sleeping person. Three people are lying on the floor in the back. I speak briefly to [LOCATION], a new employee of [ORGANIZATION]. When I ask PERSON3 how the homeless can be helped and what should be done, he speaks of a lack of motivation, of people going down a path of not caring anymore instead of having a fire burning in you. PERSON3 talks about the need for a work ethic, and how its too simplistic to say the homeless problem is an effect of the citys expensive housing. But hes also adamant that people need help We just cant give up on the willing, he says. I ask him if the homeless people he encounters have loved ones or families who could help. PERSON3 says most of them are probably embarrassed to go home because you dont want to hear it from your family anymore after presumably failing in previous tries to get off the streets.6.",san francisco,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions, ask a genuine question]

The mention of a candidate using a “giant ball of trash” and the “conspicuous presence of the unhoused” reflects media portrayal, NIMBY sentiment, and harmful generalizations. No racial bias is present. Solutions/interventions are implied by questioning what candidates plan to do."

"Doing so would give the citys homeless community space to shelter in [STREET] alongside the rest of the city. Visit [ORGANIZATION] homepage for more stories1.

The measure requires the city to find 7,000 hotel rooms for its unhoused residents. But in total, 8,[ADDRESS] alongside the rest of the city as the coronavirus, which causes the disease known as [ORGANIZATION], continues to spread. When the regionwide shelter-in-[STREET] order went into effect on [ORGANIZATION], those who are homeless were exempt and instead instructed to wait until officials could find ways to house them during the public health crisis. In addition to housing and protecting the citys most vulnerable residents, doing so would also help mitigate an outbreak, which would prevent the healthcare system from potentially being overwhelmed. But an outbreak has already hit the homeless community. On [DATE], the first positive case in a [ORGANIZATION] [INSTITUTION] was found at the citys [ORGANIZATION]. And on [PERSON], two more cases were confirmed at [ORGANIZATION], the citys largest [INSTITUTION].

For [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] has been pushing forward with a mission to identify temporary housing and treatment sites that would prioritize isolation housing for those on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the estimated8,0007who are unhoused. Since the citys travel and tourism industries have been hit hard amid the coronavirus pandemic, the thousands of empty hotel rooms have become a viable solution.

The most vulnerable within the homeless community, people DATE8 with underlying health issues, also qualify to be housed in a hotel room designated for this purpose. But Mayor [PERSON] said despite the pandemic, there are limits to how officials can house people.

Instead, it requires that proportions of revenue go toward general categories of assistance At least 50 percent for getting homeless people into housing.

We need to actually minimize police intervention, said [PERSON], who in [ORGANIZATION] retired as director of homeless services for [ORGANIZATION].

"Its the difference between a measure of an activity versus a change in someones life, she said. Outcome goes beyond Heres a bed to Lets not make someone homeless anymore. To that end, local and state governments are increasingly experimenting with what are called social impact bonds, a novel pay for success model of financing services through private capital. Investors are repaid, with a small profit, only if a project proves successful. Since their debut [ORGANIZATION], these bonds have generated 200 million in [ORGANIZATION] and 14 other countries toward programs to reduce homelessness and related social problems. [PERSON] could tap into this new funding source to permanently house homeless families, as well as help low-income mothers and at-risk youth, after the city upgrades and unifies its computer systems. [ORGANIZATION], however, is already experimenting with leveraging private investment to house 150 to 200 people who are among the countys most costly and chronically homeless individuals. In [LOCATION], the county raised about 7 million for [ORGANIZATION], one of four social impact bonds established as of DATE2 targeting about 1,200 homeless individuals or families in [ORGANIZATION]. The others are in GPE3 nearly 9 million for 250 individuals, GPE4 3.5 million for up to 800 people and [PERSON], GPE6, which includes GPE7 4 million for 135 families. See [ORGANIZATION] Impact Bond Projects1The DATE3 [ORGANIZATION] project emerged after a study of the records of more than 100,000 homeless individuals from [ORGANIZATION] to DATE5. The review found that around 2,800 chronically homeless individuals cost the county an average of 83,000 [DATE]. That was nearly half of all public service costs. The federal government defines a chronically homeless individual as someone who has been homeless for [ORGANIZATION] or has experienced at least four episodes of homelessness in [LOCATION], and has a long-term disabling condition. [ORGANIZATION] targets these highest-need individuals  the top 5 percent of the chronically homeless  through what is known as a housing first model, said [ORGANIZATION], an associate professor in [ORGANIZATION] at [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], the projects independent evaluator. Based on a previous housing-first program for a broader group of homeless people, the countys costs fell 70 percent DATE8 for those who remained housed through the program. After contemplating the pay-for- success approach, [PERSON] determined in a [DATE] [LOCATION] feasibility study that it did not have the baseline data system required to track target populations, the types of services needed or outcomes on services provided. That could change. With the creation of [ORGANIZATION] and its recent investment in [LOCATION]  a unified network to better collect and manage data on the homeless population  the city is closer to adopting a pay-for- success model. The question is Will the city turn to social impact bonds to do so?The [ORGANIZATION] conventional investments, social impact bonds raise private seed money for long-term, innovative endeavors such as keeping the homeless housed and reducing their use of costly emergency services. Spending tax dollars directly on challenging problems or populations is usually a hard sell politically. What differentiates a social impact bond from other general outcomes-based approaches is the use of outside investors to front direct-service costs. This lets governments test new interventions without digging into their budgets right away and pay only when goals are reached. The best part, some experts say, is that these bonds align governments, nonprofits and the private sector in a [STREET] not seen before. The structure links the capital provider much more directly to Are these peoples lives being improved long term for themselves and for the society? said [PERSON], managing director of lending and investment at [ORGANIZATION], which has invested in homelessness bonds for [ORGANIZATION] and GPE9 counties.

"And not all of the controllers economic forecasts of the new tax on the local economy were negative.

"But many such properties are modern buildings in good repair with many necessary amenities for residential use already in [STREET], such as parking and modern utility services. Repurposing such properties may sidestep some of the factors that have contributed to a near-doubling of the cost of building housing in [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], a trend that - coupled with [LOCATION] of legal challenges - has increasingly led to even small-scale affordable housing projects becoming financially infeasible before ground is ever broken15.Project Roomkey16 - the state program to house homeless persons at high risk of acquiring COVID-19 - includes a clause allowing the state to negotiate with owners to subsequently purchase these properties and convert them permanently to housing for the homeless.

"Visit [ORGANIZATION] homepage for more stories1. An emergency ordinance was introduced [ORGANIZATION] that would require [ORGANIZATION] to find and rent 7,000 hotel rooms to house all of [ORGANIZATION]s homeless population during the coronavirus pandemic. In a virtual news conference [ORGANIZATION]2, five members of [ORGANIZATION] announced they are backing the proposed ordinance, which would require the city to procure the rooms by DATE2, the projected [ORGANIZATION] for the number of confirmed cases to hit its peak in the state of GPE2. According to a press release, the mandate also includes establishing 750 rooms for healthcare workers and first responders who have been infected with or exposed to the virus, as well as 500 rooms for those being released from local hospitals following infection of or exposure to the virus but who cannot self-isolate at home. According to an article4 the [ORGANIZATION] Examiner, the full board plans to vote on the proposal next [ORGANIZATION] it will require eight votes to pass under emergency rules. Since the coronavirus disease, known as [ORGANIZATION], reached [ORGANIZATION] in [ORGANIZATION], the city has endeavored to address how the illness could impact its sizable homeless community. There are an estimated 8,0005 unhoused people in the city, and an outbreak among that population could overwhelm the healthcare system. Renting empty hotel rooms throughout [ORGANIZATION] has been apart of the citys broader mission to prep temporary treatment and housing sites for not just those who are homeless, but also first responders and healthcare workers who require self-isolation. Asimilar plan6to house the homeless population in [PERSON] is in [STREET]. The citys travel and tourism industries have been slammed amid the coronavirus pandemic, rendering hotel rooms empty throughout [ORGANIZATION]. As the plan stands now, the homeless people in [ORGANIZATION] who would be moved to the hotel rooms are those who have tested positive for [ORGANIZATION] or who have been tested and are waiting for results to return. The most vulnerable within the homeless community, people over [PERSON] with underlying health issues, also qualify to be housed in a hotel room designated for this purpose. About 9457 hotel rooms have already been leased across eight hotels. But some officials8 and homeless advocates argue that the thousands of empty hotel rooms in the city should be used to house the entire homeless population in the city as a preventative measure, regardless of the need for self-isolation. The plan has never included those living on the streets  only those in existing shelters  and unhoused people are at a much higher risk of contracting the disease. But Mayor [PERSON] said despite the pandemic, there are limits to how officials can house people. We are not going to be able to solve our homeless problem in [ORGANIZATION] with this crisis,[PERSON] said Friday.9 If this emergency ordinance passes, however, it would introduce an urgency to sheltering every unhoused person in the city in spaces fit for healthy social, or physical, distancing practices. Housing those living on the streets in homeless shelters isnt an option at the moment  the city has banned new admissions10 to maintain healthy physical distancing among residents already there. The city has toyed with turning its FAC0 and FAC1 into mega-shelters housing up to 400 and 162 people, respectively. But those plans were scaled back11 after a backlash was stirred over the camp-like living conditions slated for the facilities.

PERSON1, now a housing reporter for [ORGANIZATION], recounts how receiving a blanket from a stranger back when she was homeless was such a gift of kindness in a sea of callousness it helped her remember there was such a thing as love in the world. In the episodes solutions segment, she discusses sleeplessness among unhoused people and the importance of understanding and addressing trauma. Current Issue [PERSON]  In episode two, A Veteran Journalist [PERSON] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] host PERSON2 tells the shocking story of how his illustrious career in journalism fell apart in middle age. A former host of ORG1 Talk of the [ORGANIZATION] and chief national correspondent of [ORGANIZATION] discusses building his journalism career in predominantly white newsrooms and ultimately losing his job and health insurance, while facing down cancer and subsequent medical debt. Explaining the crisis facing older workers, he offers insights into how to fix this uniquely American condition. He also speaks to the impact of the ageism, racism, and paternalism built into the DNA of our newsrooms, along with the broader precariousness of the media industry. Future episodes will explore life on the front lines of the pandemic, the administrative burden of accessing social services, the crisis of affordable housing, and the faulty American concept of rugged individualism. They will also address solutions to class blindness and intolerance, rethinking our social safety nets, fixing our broken housing market, and looking at the closest model the [ORGANIZATION] has for universal health care.",san francisco,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions]

"Id like to see a suite of recommendations from this stakeholder process for the [ORGANIZATION] to consider, prior to making necessary changesupgrades. PERSON0 Changes to the ORG2 ordinance removal of the exemption for mixed-use buildings, an actual number for minimums in the [ORGANIZATION] to be determined by [ORGANIZATION] using evidence and input from local developers, update the in-lieu fee, and include the recommendations from [ORGANIZATION]. By its nature, new construction is expensive, though residential rents have gone up a lot faster than materials costs. Refurbishing existing housing stock to ORG2 is a good [STREET] to make more headway on this issue and would be a more efficient use of the ORG2 fund. Also, there is affordable housing that is not officially designated [PERSON]. Many of the older apartment complexes - many near downtown - are heavily populated by working families. We must not trade this for new construction with what can be defined as [PERSON]. The FAC0 project is an example of defined ORG2 that is actually more expensive than existing market-rate housing. This is a somewhat shameful use of an equation to make a project look good. Additionally, ORG2 numbers should be net numbers. For example, the FAC1 project removed housing that was less expensive than the ORG2 associated with that project. Again, using math to make things look better than they are should not be [PERSON] policy. Long-term affordability - increasing limited-equity ownership opportunities a la Dos Pinos, etc. allows a much broader swath of the economic spectrum to gain equity and improve their economic station. District 5 PERSON1 The [PERSON] should enforce the existing ordinance and be consistent in its expectations from developers. In the current environment, projects and modifications to affordable housing are approved on an ad-hoc basis, which creates great inconsistencies in affordable housing inventory. [PERSON] housing requirements exist for proposed development projects and enforcing these requirements would create more certainty for developers and add to the affordable housing supply. Approval of the [ORGANIZATION] Plan with a focus on densification and building up would create more opportunities for affordable housing units. If we truly value equity and inclusivity, then the best [STREET] forward is to have a diverse plan that leads to more affordable units on the ground. Expanding [ORGANIZATION] will support a wide variety of affordable housing development. Slight increases in development impact fees, allocating [ORGANIZATION] to this fund, and re-exploring the 50 social services parcel tax that was proposed by Mayor [PERSON] are several options to explore. While as a small business owner I recognize the economic impact of the pandemic on all businesses, cities of comparable size in [ORGANIZATION] have much higher in-lieu fees and this is a realistic approach to building more affordable housing. [ORGANIZATION] should work to address the anti-development culture. There is a tremendous amount of misunderstanding about how much affordable housing single development projects generate. A social services parcel tax, which would generate 1.5 million a year, will open new and more sustainable ways to fund affordable housing. PERSON3 Things like affordable rent by the bed allows property owners to charge higher prices for a unit by increasing the occupancy of a two bedroom to four people for instance. This is unacceptable. The current affordable housing ordinance offers too much flexibility and opportunities for developers to get around providing units at affordable prices. Building market rate housing in [PERSON] will make money. Period. Rents and housing appreciation are so high, and vacancy rates so low that we can and should ask more of developers and current development. I would recommend a simplified affordable housing ordinance for rentals that includes the following or something similar. 25 of rented units going to households making less than 120 of [PERSON] median income with price capped at 75 of market rate and 10 of rented units going to households making less than 80 of [PERSON] median income with price capped at 50 of market rate.",san francisco,"Comment Type: [express their opinion, provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, ask a genuine question]

"If elected, how would you change the affordable housing ordinance and what policies would you pass to ensure that affordable housing can get financed and built at the level you advocate?District 2 PERSON0 DATE0 ORG0 made a decision to essentially nullify their affordable housing ordinance and specifically the provisions that require a percentage of affordable housing to be built in new developments. Many thought that this provision was an obstacle to building any housing at all. Though I recognize that some developers said that these affordable housing thresholds were financially unworkable in housing developments, this decision overtime will reduce the stock of affordable housing in [ORGANIZATION]. I believe the best [STREET] for the city to start improving the situation is to recommit to its own affordable housing ordinance. This will help expand the stock of affordable housing built in future development projects. As market-rate housing expands, so should the availability of affordable housing. The city should also encourage more developers to contribute to the housing trust fund. This would give the city resources to finance the building of additional affordable housing or to provide other kinds of support for those struggling to afford rising housing costs. At some points in the past developers have use the option of housing trust fund contributions to get out of obligations to build affordable housing units. To avoid this, the city should use this option in conjunction with the building of affordable housing units, along with making sure that developer contributions are fair for the community and have an actual impact addressing housing needs. PERSON1 The loss of redevelopment funding is regrettable, but affordable housing is continuing to be built across the state with other sources of funding and mechanisms. The end of redevelopment agencies has not been the end of affordable housing construction. The first step is to do an independent, in-depth study that looks at what level of inclusionary housing is actually achievable. We need a solid understanding of what can work so that the city is not relying on subjective claims by developers of what does or does not pencil out. The city needs an independent arbitrator of how affordable housing can be included so we can maximize affordable units in future projects. Secondly, I would like to look into restoring the suspended Middle Income Ordinance to provide affordable workforce housing.",san francisco,"Comment Type: [ask a genuine question, provide a fact or claim, express their opinion, express others opinions]

Neither [ORGANIZATION] nor [PERSON] has put forth a price tag for that treatment  but it is likely far higher than simply providing beds for people, as the current shelter model does. The candidates do, however, have a point that more mental health treatment is sorely needed.

The state budget for [ORGANIZATION] includes 805 million for counties to purchase, build, preserve, or rehabilitate such facilities17, but the state has yet to patch the growing hole in the availability and delivery of mental health treatment. The prevalence of mental illness among the homeless is a source of debate18, and being on the streets can worsen existing mental health conditions.

"The will-nots become very sophisticated at getting things for nothing - the government doesnt make a distinction between the unwilling and the unable - as a result the unwilling will always have the ability to crowd out the unable. The result of laws aimed at helping the homeless, the Federal Hearth Act, or at criminal justice reform, [PERSON]. [DATE] and AB 953, are that the will-nots generally receive the bulk of the services aimed at helping the homeless, despite the fact that their treatment is invariably more expensive, and the likelihood they will ever change is much lower. Left behind are the cannots and the have-nots. Also left behind, at least when it comes to funding, are organizations that work on permanent transformation, instead of mere containment. To state the obvious, all of this must change. Here are some ways to make that happenSolutions to [ORGANIZATION] Up the Trash With [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], and other cities already facing the imminent threat of a breakout disease epidemic, this measure comes before all others. It ought to be easy, [ORGANIZATION] cities in [ORGANIZATION] were not inundated with tons of uncollected trash on the streets. In the case of [ORGANIZATION], if their recently launched [ORGANIZATION] program is truly the corruption riddled, ineffective, price gouging, trash neglecting disaster it appears to be, then cancel the program and go back to what worked in the past. The failure of large urban cities to even pick up their trash points to larger shifts in culture and governance that have to be addressed. Some cities, notably [PERSON], still manage to fulfill most of these basic obligations of local government. To the extent that piled up trash remains a problem after waste management contracts are restructured and the system of garbage collection works again, these larger structural issues have to be addressed - starting with the homeless encampments. Time could be running out. If rodent populations arent brought under control - perhaps also by temporarily permitting application of otherwise problematic rodenticides in infested urban settings - large numbers of innocent people may become afflicted with deadly diseases. If this does happen, it will be something that was totally avoidable. Look for an avalanche of lawsuits and possible criminal prosecutions against negligent local politicians. Lower the Cost of New Housing This is a monster topic, but cannot be excluded from any discussion of the homeless crisis. In some respects it is an excuse, since with other policy revisions it would be possible to shelter the homeless without having to engage in ridiculously expensive housing solutions.

"As a wet shelter, it will become a hotel for freeloading partiers as much as a refuge for the truly needy.

"These costs are utterly unsustainable. But [ORGANIZATION] has grown into a juggernaut, crushing the opposition. At community hearings across [ORGANIZATION], homeless advocates, who are often bused in from other areas expressly to shout down local opposition, demand action, because no one deserves to live on a sidewalk. Money is squandered, and the population of homeless people multiplies. [PERSON] has the fourth highest number of homeless of any city in the [PERSON], over 8,500. According to [ORGANIZATION], operator of a privately funded [INSTITUTION] in [ORGANIZATION], there are two ways to treat the homeless, the transformational model and the containment model. The transformation model works to identify homeless individuals who are able to transition back to self-sufficiency and gives them the training and services to accomplish that. The containment model emphasizes getting shelter for the homeless before offering additional services. [PERSON] is critical of a relatively recent federal law, the [ORGANIZATION] Hearth Act, that bureaucratized the process of getting public money to combat homelessness at the same time as it made it harder to secure funding for transformational programs. Since [ORGANIZATION], all organizations set up to help the homeless have to submit applications through regional quasi-government organizations called continuums of care. The applications have to be evidence based and reliant on data such as the ORG2 point in time counts. All grant requests as well have to include homelessness management information systems that facilitate coordinated entry of the homeless into supportive care. The new guidelines, enforced by ORG2, also incorporated low barrier entry requirements in order to reach the most vulnerable. This meant applicants could not prohibit drug use, they cant require work, and they cannot require program compliance. Applicants for state and local grants have to adhere to these same ORG2 guidelines. [PERSON]s organization, [PERSON], requires no drug use, work, they have roommate restrictions, partying restrictions, and they do drug testing. This means that they cant accept federal funds and they also arent eligible for state funds because of the housing first rule, meaning that housing has to be provided before providing any other solutions to homelessness. The implications of the Hearth Act on how the homeless are treated go well beyond determining who gets funds. It has created an incentive for homeless organizations to prioritize helping drug addicts, because one of the ways to attract benefits to help the homeless is by getting [ORGANIZATION] income. The so-called housing navigators who help qualify people for SSDI know it is easier to secure this benefit if the person is afflicted with drug addiction. According to [PERSON], there are three types of homeless. The cannots who are mentally ill or disabled these comprise about 15 percent of the homeless. Then there are the have nots who could succeed if they were trained to acquire new skills and had access to services. The have-nots are often not counted they live doubled up in homes, with friends, in cars, many of them are single mothers who want to avoid living on the [STREET].

Why, if so much money is being wasted, and the homeless crisis seems to be more acute than ever, are the absolute numbers of homeless actually falling? First of all, the numbers may be incorrect. These counts may be grossly understated. An illuminating critique of how ORG2s point-in-time homeless count may be understating the numbers was published by [ORGANIZATION] in [LOCATION]. Author PERSON0 participated in an official count, covering a section of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], in [TIME] of [DATE]. ORG2 requires cities and counties to complete the count, on [PERSON], [PERSON], in order to receive federal funding for homeless programs. But canvassing the streets of any city during the pre-dawn hours during [ORGANIZATION] is bound to miss a lot of people. Quoting from the article, The count is during [LOCATION] [TIME], when its harder to actually find folks because theyre seeking some sort of refuge. They want to stay out of sight in general for their own safety. Knowing just how many Americans are homeless is further complicated by competing definitions of homelessness. ORG3 [ORGANIZATION] claimed in a [ORGANIZATION] report that 1.3 million K-12 students were homeless in DATE9. But [ORGANIZATION] defines the homeless as not only those who are unsheltered or in homeless shelters, but those sharing housing due to loss of their own home, or living in hotels or motels. Even in [ORGANIZATION], a state where homelessness is now a crisis célèbre for state legislators in [LOCATION], and a cautionary horror story for conservative critics of [ORGANIZATION] politics, at first glance, the overall numbers suggest the problem is overblown. On the map depicted below, using ORG2 data, the state by state homeless trend is shown for [DATE] from [LOCATION] to [LOCATION]3, in which [ORGANIZATION]s total homeless population actually dropped by 3.4 percent. But reports from around the state dispute the ORG2 assessment. According to a [LOCATION]1 article published in [ORGANIZATION], in GPE4, the number of homeless residents jumped 43 percent over [LOCATION]2. In [PERSON], that number was 42 percent. GPE6 volunteers surveying the regions homeless population found a 50 percent increase over [DATE]. GPE7 notched a 17 percent increase since [LOCATION]3. When [PERSON] officials released the results of their most recent count, homelessness was up by 12 percent over [LOCATION]4 in the county and up 16 percent in the City of [PERSON]. Nobody seems to know whether these flaws and ambiguities in how the homeless are counted mean that the crisis is in fact worse now than ever, despite official numbers showing a decline. But total numbers alone dont tell the whole story. How the homeless are treated, and where the homeless are concentrated, has changed a great deal in [LOCATION]5. This is the real reason the homeless crisis [LOCATION]6 is worse than ever. The next map, below, using data from [ORGANIZATION], shows [DATE] estimates of the total homeless population by state. Viewed in this context, the states where homelessness increased dramatically over [LOCATION]5, [ORGANIZATION]0, [ORGANIZATION]1, and [ORGANIZATION]2, nonetheless confront a relatively insignificant challenge. As of [DATE], the estimated homeless population of all three of those states combined totaled only 2,340 people. Most homeless, on the other hand, are concentrated in states that share one or more of three characteristics a mild [LOCATION]7 climate, large urban centers, and liberal politics. [ORGANIZATION]3, with the nations second largest homeless population, fulfills two of those three criteria. Sunny [ORGANIZATION], in first [STREET] with an estimated homeless population exceeding 129,000 in [DATE], fulfills all three. Whether the numbers of homeless people are up or down in [ORGANIZATION] is only half the story. How [ORGANIZATION]s homelessness has worsened over [LOCATION]5 represents a qualitative change. The mismanagement of [ORGANIZATION]s homeless can be attributed to FAC0, but other policy failures are also to blame. All in all, [ORGANIZATION]s response to homelessness is a textbook example of how to get almost everything wrong. Policies That Made [ORGANIZATION]s Homeless Crisis WorseAn assortment of policy failures can be directly linked to why homelessness in [ORGANIZATION] is a bigger problem than ever, even in the unlikely event the numbers of homeless have not dramatically increased. These policy failures have taken the form of overzealous [STREET] rulings, citizen approved ballot measures that wreaked havoc in their unintended consequences, and flawed legislation. [STREET] Decisions ORG7, unsurprisingly, is the author of at least three rulings that have tied the hands of law enforcement in dealing with the homeless. The first of these is [PERSON] v. the City of [PERSON], decided in [LOCATION]8, that ruled that law enforcement and city officials can no longer enforce the ban on sleeping on sidewalks anywhere within the [PERSON] city limits until a sufficient amount of permanent supportive housing could be built.",san francisco,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions]

Reasoning: The comment provides numerous facts and claims about homeless counts, funding, and policy outcomes, as well as observations about bureaucratic inefficiency and the challenges of counting the homeless. It expresses the author's opinion that government and nonprofit responses are mismanaged and inefficient, and references opinions of others (e.g., conservative critics, volunteers, officials). There is critique of how money is allocated (overhead, waste), government policies (court rulings, legislation), and societal attitudes (liberal politics, crisis célèbre). The text references media reports and generalizes about where homelessness is concentrated (e.g., states with ""liberal politics""), which can be seen as a harmful generalization.

"As shown, 57 percent of Black children in [ORGANIZATION] were being raised by single mothers, compared to only 18 percent of white children. Note the remarkable degree of correlation between the proportions of homeless by race, and the proportions of single parent households by race. Its easy, and plays well to the crowd, to attribute minority homelessness to racism. But a growing body of evidence suggests that intact families are the prevailing indicator of individual success in life. Until that evidence is confronted by the communities affected by it, other suggested causes for minorities being disproportionately represented among the homeless lack authenticity, and smack of opportunism. Untie Hands of Law Enforcement The theory of [PERSON], or order maintenance policing argues that tolerating too much local disorder created a climate in which criminal behavior, including serious crimes, would become more likely, since criminals would sense that public norms and vigilance were weak. [PERSON] policing, whereby police crack down on low level crimes, was begun in [LOCATION] in [ORGANIZATION] and is often credited with greatly reducing crime rates. At the other extreme is the near lawlessness that prevails on the streets of [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and other cities experiencing a homeless crisis. In GPE4, as described, well-intentioned citizen approved ballot measures and ill-conceived legislation have tied the hands of law enforcement.",san francisco,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, express their opinion, provide an observation, express others opinions]

Reasoning: The comment provides statistics about Black and white single-parent households, claims a correlation with homelessness, and expresses the opinion that family structure, not racism, is the main cause of minority homelessness. It critiques both government policy (law enforcement restrictions) and societal explanations (racism as a cause), and references others’ opinions (theory of policing). The reasoning implies harmful generalizations about Black families and homelessness, and questions the legitimacy of attributing homelessness to racism, which constitutes implicit racial bias. It also makes judgments about who is ""deserving"" based on family structure."

"Often the afflicted have family members that have the means to help, and are desperate to get their relative into treatment, but the laws prevent them. Approximately 15 percent of the homeless are mentally ill arguably, the alcoholics and drug addicts are also suffering from a form of mental illness. Together these cohorts constitute well over half of all homeless, and nearly all of the unsheltered homeless seen on the streets. Families, caseworkers, and mental health professionals need to be given the legal tools to help these people. Overturn [ORGANIZATION] vs [ORGANIZATION] and similar [STREET] rulings Starting over [ORGANIZATION] with the [PERSON] decision in the case [ORGANIZATION] vs the City of [ORGANIZATION], homeless cannot be prohibited from sleeping on the [STREET] unless permanent supportive housing is available. Similar rulings have been issued in [PERSON] and GPE2. The impact of these rulings, combined with the other constraints on law enforcement, make it nearly impossible to clear the streets of homeless encampments. The problem has been exacerbated by subsequent lawsuits to enforce the [ORGANIZATION] decision which have defined permanent supportive housing in ways that make it more expensive. The practical impact of the [ORGANIZATION] case has been to make it financially infeasible to ever deliver adequate housing alternatives to the homeless. A major city with the financial wherewithal to pay for a sustained legal battle needs to challenge the [ORGANIZATION] decision all the [STREET] to ORG1, with the objective being a ruling that will permit less elaborate, more cost-effective housing and shelter solutions to be allowable. Set Limits on Costs In [ORGANIZATION] DATE2, a temporary shelter designed to last [ORGANIZATION] is being constructed at a cost of over 50,000 per bed, and permanent supportive housing units are being constructed for, on average, over 400,000 each. [ORGANIZATION] is also planning to deploy mobile toilets for the homeless to use, with the expected cost per unit of 339,000 per year. In [PERSON], the cost for existing programs to help the homeless is approximately 100,000 per homeless person per year. Given the number of unsheltered homeless in [PERSON], this spending is totally ineffective. These costs are absurd. Designing solutions that cost less, but offer shelter to 100 percent of the homeless, is vastly preferable to solutions that cost so much that only a fraction of the homeless get assistance. Creative solutions exist that cost far less. Off the shelf tents, sheds, prefab tiny homes, and prefab homes made from shipping containers are all less costly options. Relocating the homeless to repurposed industrial or retail sites that are already built out and not on premium real estate would cut costs. Putting shelters in the middle of some of the most expensive real estate on earth not only squanders finite available funds, but when the unused property is government owned, the chance is lost to sell that property and invest the proceeds in less expensive locations.",san francisco,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions]

"Needless to say, officers, and their departments, may become reluctant to exceed their quotas, and as a result have an incentive to not make stops when stops are warranted.

Ever since, and especially in [LOCATION] as the percentage of homeless who suffer from mental illness has increased, attempts to reform the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act have been tenaciously resisted by the ORG1 and other homeless advocacy groups.

"But providing addiction infrastructure has the predictable consequence of attracting addicts, and the more addiction infrastructure is provided, the more addicts are attracted.

"[ORGANIZATION] shelters provide a small platform from which people can rebuild their lives, but are also affordable enough to be able to scale to meet the citys immense problem. As the next chart shows, [ORGANIZATION] Citys nearly 800 shelters with an [TIME] capacity of over 62,000 individuals gives them a rate of unsheltered homeless of only 45 per 100,000 residents. [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], by contrast, have a rate of unsheltered homeless ten times higher [PERSON], five times higher. Whats different in these cities?Part of it is [ORGANIZATION]s legacy of providing assistance to the homeless dating back to the Great Depression of the [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION]s network of [TIME] shelters were acquired over [LOCATION], meaning [ORGANIZATION]ers DATE2 are able to allocate a higher percentage of the nearly 1.7 billion in city, state and federal money on caseworkers and shelter subsidies, and relatively less on acquisition of new shelter capacity. And because [ORGANIZATION] City prioritizes providing immediate shelter over the far more expensive permanent supportive housing, what seems like a prodigious amount budgeted to help the homeless comes out to only around 21,000 per homeless person. One obvious challenge facing cities such as [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and other [ORGANIZATION] cities facing a homeless crisis is the high cost of housing. But other policies have helped cause the problem, and are making the problem worse. As described, state and local laws, [STREET] rulings and citizen initiatives have all made GPE7 homeless crisis much harder to manage. Not only is it harder to compel the homeless to seek shelter, or get them into treatment for addiction and mental illness, or prosecute them for criminal offenses, but the emphasis on permanent supportive housing takes money away from funds that could be used for [TIME] shelters. Up north, [PERSON] faces similar policy failures. Four articles published in [ORGANIZATION] over [ORGANIZATION] by [ORGANIZATION], a research fellow at [ORGANIZATION], offer a blistering critique of [PERSON]s inept response to homelessness, and the growing backlash from residents. For starters, the [PERSON] metro area spends more than 1.0 billion fighting homelessness [PERSON]. That equates to nearly 100,000 per homeless individual living in [PERSON], nearly five times as much as [ORGANIZATION] City spends. And yet, as previously shown, [PERSON]s rate of unsheltered homeless is five times greater than [ORGANIZATION] City. By these measures, [ORGANIZATION] City is twenty-five times more efficient at battling homelessness than [PERSON]. Why is it that [PERSON], [PERSON], home to what is arguably the second biggest high-tech nexus on earth, a locus for fabulous wealth and a [STREET] of dazzling scenic beauty, with per capita income 50 percent higher than [ORGANIZATION] City, cant begin to manage their homeless problem?PERSON3 attributes the root cause of [PERSON]s failure to what he calls unlimited compassion, and calls for a complete rethink of the assumptions that guide policies towards the homeless. It would not be much of an overstatement to characterize [ORGANIZATION] lengthy first article, from [PERSON], entitled [PERSON] Under Siege, as a seminal manifesto challenging the entire ideological framework of the compassion brigades that dominate [PERSON] politics. This ideology is not unique to [PERSON]. It informs failed homeless policies across the [ORGANIZATION], especially in blue states, and especially on the [ORGANIZATION]. The [ORGANIZATION] Ideology That Fails to Help the HomelessWhat PERSON3 identifies as the four ideological power centers that frame the homeless debate in [PERSON] and elsewhere are the socialists, the compassion brigades, the addiction evangelists, and the homeless-industrial complex. The first three fit nicely into a [ORGANIZATION] ideology. The last of [ORGANIZATION] categories, his shared concern about the homeless industrial complex, is a bit more complicated, and motivated not by ideology but by desire for power and profit. More on that later. An interesting fact about the urban centers on the [ORGANIZATION] is that their high-tech driven wealth is highly correlated with higher wealth inequality, along with higher home prices and higher rents. And where the rich and poor live elbow to elbow at the same time as the cost-of-living soars, socialists come out of the woodwork, offering indignant soundbites and instant solutions. In [PERSON], along with [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and elsewhere, avowed socialists sit on the city councils, offering a political agenda thats guaranteed to make everything worse for the people its supposed to help. In [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] member is [ORGANIZATION], who along with PERSON5, the new of boss the homeless activist group [ORGANIZATION], promotes an agenda that is all too familiar for anyone watching urban politics in cities controlled by liberals. For [PERSON], that agenda includes rent control, public housing, minimum-wage hikes, and punitive corporate taxation. As for [ORGANIZATION], PERSON3 writes In an op-ed in the [PERSON] Times, she lays out her plan to address the root causes of homelessness by solving racism, wage inequity, climate change, housing costs, public transportation, green building, sanctuary cities, the child-welfare system, brain injuries, and mental-health and addiction services. Needless to say, this socialist agenda will never solve the problem of homelessness. Rent control discourages investment in housing public housing is rarely built cost-effectively, especially in blue cities with extreme environmentalist building codes and costly labor laws, minimum wage hikes are job killers, and punitive corporate taxes send corporations packing for GPE10. The most ironic thing about the socialist agenda in [ORGANIZATION] GPE11 is that it is inevitably co-opted by the corporate [LOCATION]. The only thing these two special interests have in common, ultimately, is a vested interest in never seeing lasting solutions to any of the problems theyre supposedly fighting to solve. Lasting solutions would end their revenue streams. Compassion brigades, as PERSON3 puts it, are the moral crusaders of homelessness policy, the activists who put signs on their lawns that read In this house, we believe black lives matter, womens rights are human rights, no human is illegal, and so on. They see compassion as the highest virtue all else must be subordinated to it.",san francisco,"Comment Type: [provide a fact or claim, provide an observation, express their opinion, express others opinions]

"Even in [ORGANIZATION], where safe parking is becoming more common, only 10 of the citys streets allow residents to lodge in their vehicle. These restrictions are often driven by concerns over homeless residents bringing crime, litter, or noise to a neighborhood. A better use of parking spacesTheres an irony to all of this controversy. Aside from their ability to safely shelter homeless residents, parking lots take up quite a bit of unnecessary space in cities. A recent study13from [ORGANIZATION] found that cities often have more parking spaces than their residents require. In certain parts of [ORGANIZATION], parking accounted for 40 of the land area, despite the fact that nearly half of all of households didnt own or operate a car. And in [ORGANIZATION], the city had enough parking space to give four spots to every household. This pattern is likely to grow worse as the share of drivers in GPE3 cities continues to decline. With many parking lots left unoccupied, these spaces could easily be converted into a more permanent solution for homeless residents affordable housing. The problem is that developers and landowners profit far more from parking structures than they do from affordable development. In many cases, developers are even required14 to install a certain number of parking spaces in residential or office buildings. This has the effect of driving up [LOCATION] in cities, making them less accommodating to low-income residents. As cities debate whether to expand or restrict their safe parking programs, they must confront an unfortunate paradox Parking lots might lessen the strain of homelessness in cities, but theyre also a big part of the problem.

"Signs around downtown now say that loitering is prohibited, and that the sidewalk is for pedestrian movement only  a reference to [ORGANIZATION]s no-sit policy, according to [ORGANIZATION]. Though the letter itself did not mention homelessness at all, some in the [ORGANIZATION] community interpreted the signs and the letter as an attack on an already-vulnerable population. We think its disgusting that a CEO that happened to give so much money to Mayor [PERSON] campaign can write an op-ed and instantly these signs go up that no one is allowed to sit in front of his business, [PERSON], the founder of [ORGANIZATION]s Resistance, the group that organized the protest, told ORG2 affiliate [PERSON]. We shouldnt be criminalizing things homeless people need to do to survive. Protesters held signs with slogans like [PERSON] is a last resort, not a crime and Making hardship harder wont make it go away. In a statement released on [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] said Its irresponsible to conflate homelessness and crime. We can address safety issues with common sense enforcement. We can address homelessness with compassion. Thats our plan. The store reopened on [LOCATION], but the protesters say they may be back. In response to the protests, [ORGANIZATION] released a statement from [PERSON], [ORGANIZATION] Sportswear Company delivered a truckload of coats to ORG7, an important nonprofit that assists homeless individuals in [ORGANIZATION], and our team participated in TV interviews stressing the importance of providing support for communities in need. DATE3, I published an opinion piece in [ORGANIZATION] urging city leaders to address urgent safety issues in downtown [ORGANIZATION] in part by providing resources for community policing. My opinion piece in [ORGANIZATION] did not address homelessness generally. The word does not appear in the article, because the concerns about safety are not tied solely to that issue. The call for community policing resources got far more attention, but the spotlight needs to be much broader. You would be hard-pressed to name all the agencies and enterprises who are involved in some [STREET] in these inter-related issues. There are issues that touch the state, the city, the county, and there are no doubt resources being spent by public bodies that no one thinks of in connection with homelessness. At times [ORGANIZATION]ers seem to be talking past each other, choosing one side or another to what is inherently a multi-sided issue. We can and should - and We do - show compassion to support individuals in need. At the same time, we can and should provide resources for law enforcement to provide greater safety for all. While this a challenging situation, I refuse to give up, and I would encourage all Oregonians to devote time, attention, and, yes, resources to address the complex issues surrounding homelessness. In meetings with local and state leaders in [PERSON] I have offered to contribute personally to genuine solutions  not policing  and I have reiterated my belief that others in the business community should join this effort. I am glad to call business leaders personally to ask them to contribute. We cannot solve all problems, and we will likely never address all the needs related to homelessness, but as Oregonians we can make meaningful progress if our leaders business, government, nonprofits and others have the will to do so.

"So when officials say they want to make housing more affordable by building denser housing, they arent talking about building 2,400-square-foot homes, the average size of new single-family homes17 in [ORGANIZATION]. Instead, they are talking about apartments that are less than half that size the average size of new multifamily rental units in [ORGANIZATION] was under 1,100 square feet, and many affordable housing plans call for building apartments that are as small as 660 square feet18. The Planning Conspiracy Although affordable housing is the latest excuse for plans to increase housing densities, urban planners supported densification long before affordable housing became an issue.

"So much of this work, on a practical level, has always been [LOCATION] diversion, P[LOCATION]SON0 said. That mission is much more amplified in its importance now, given the need to focus hospital resources on treating Covid-19.16 Beginning on DATE0, [ORGANIZATION] worked alongside ORG1 and others in an effort to reach as much of the citys unhoused population as possible with information about Covid-19 and supplies, including hand sanitizer. At first, P[LOCATION]SON1 said, many of the people they spoke with seemed uninterested or suspicious, but over the course of [LOCATION], they became increasingly concerned. Like P[LOCATION]SON2, many were afraid of being swept up and imprisoned in shelterlike environments.17 Advocates argue8 that Covid-19 should not be used to forcibly move people into shelters. Instead, theyre calling for cities to house people in hotels or other private accommodations during the crisis, and they call for significant increases in funding for housing assistance. It has never been more clear that housing is health care, said P[LOCATION]SON3, the president and CEO of ORG2, in a statement. Advocates worry not only that the pandemic poses risks to individuals without housing but also that the economic fallout could push others into homelessness. The relief package passed by ORG3 addressed9 some of these concerns, providing 4billion to assist homeless shelters and outreach workers, 1.25 billion for Section8 housing vouchers, 685 million for public housing, and a limited eviction moratorium. Governors in [ORGANIZATION], [PERSON], and other states have implemented broader moratoriums on residential evictions.18 In response to the pandemic, [ORGANIZATION], along with other cities, decided to limit its regular sweeps of encampments10, in accordance with new guidance11 from [LOCATION], which advised that clearing camps could cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This will be a reprieve for many people living outdoors in [ORGANIZATION], which, like so many other cities, has been embroiled in contentious debates about housing affordability and the encampments. The ask from the people living outside is, If we could just stay put for a little while, wed be better able to clean up, wed do better, we would have less impact on our city, P[LOCATION]SON1 said. After some initial confusion about whether and how [ORGANIZATION]s stay-home order affected people without housing, Governor P[LOCATION]SON4 recently clarified12 that her directive is not intended to serve as an enforcement mechanism against [ORGANIZATION]s unsheltered population.[ADDRESS] Medicine prepare to treat people experiencing homelessness in the [ORGANIZATION] area.
