Neither [ORGANIZATION] nor [PERSON] has put forth a price tag for that treatment  but it is likely far higher than simply providing beds for people, as the current shelter model does. The candidates do, however, have a point that more mental health treatment is sorely needed. Board-and-care facilities for low-income Californians with serious mental illness have been shuttering across the state at an alarming rate16. The state budget for [ORGANIZATION] includes 805 million for counties to purchase, build, preserve, or rehabilitate such facilities17, but the state has yet to patch the growing hole in the availability and delivery of mental health treatment. The prevalence of mental illness among the homeless is a source of debate18, and being on the streets can worsen existing mental health conditions. There is general agreement among experts and elected officials19 that mental illness alone isnt responsible for homelessness. The people who are suffering from substance use disorder or mental illness are very visible, theyre very challenging. But there is a very large unsheltered population that doesnt have either.

Think [PERSON]. Once people are living on the [STREET], theyre much more likely to turn to drugs or alcohol, [ORGANIZATION] said. A lot of people on the streets use stimulants so they dont sleep, because when they sleep, they get assaulted, and their stuff gets stolen, she said.
