"And yes, were going to have to force people into that treatment if need be. In his homelessness plan, [ORGANIZATION] cites a [ORGANIZATION] blog post15 pointing to a study of ORG1 facilities that found nearly half of participants recovered from substance use, entered housing and maintained steady employment. Neither [ORGANIZATION] nor [PERSON] has put forth a price tag for that treatment  but it is likely far higher than simply providing beds for people, as the current shelter model does. The candidates do, however, have a point that more mental health treatment is sorely needed. Board-and-care facilities for low-income Californians with serious mental illness have been shuttering across the state at an alarming rate16. The state budget for [ORGANIZATION] includes 805 million for counties to purchase, build, preserve, or rehabilitate such facilities17, but the state has yet to patch the growing hole in the availability and delivery of mental health treatment. The prevalence of mental illness among the homeless is a source of debate18, and being on the streets can worsen existing mental health conditions. There is general agreement among experts and elected officials19 that mental illness alone isnt responsible for homelessness. The people who are suffering from substance use disorder or mental illness are very visible, theyre very challenging. But there is a very large unsheltered population that doesnt have either. PERSON2, founding executive director of ORG2 at [ORGANIZATION] Of the more than 248,000 people who accessed homeless services throughout [LOCATION], 41 reported disabling [ORGANIZATION], which could be anything from diabetes or a broken leg to a mental disorder, according to [ORGANIZATION], the states deputy secretary for homelessness at [LOCATION].

But there is a very large unsheltered population that doesnt have either. PERSON4, a professor of medicine at [ORGANIZATION], who leads the ORG6 Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative22, also says theres little evidence of correlation between mental health and homelessness. Instead, she says the places with highest homelessness have a split population of high earners who can afford to pay housing costs, and those who cant, competing for a limited supply of housing. Think [PERSON]. Once people are living on the [STREET], theyre much more likely to turn to drugs or alcohol, [ORGANIZATION] said. A lot of people on the streets use stimulants so they dont sleep, because when they sleep, they get assaulted, and their stuff gets stolen, she said.
