"I experience the same comments with non-benders in my car. It's tough because we want [ORGANIZATION] to be better, and there's been large improvements. But there is still a [ORGANIZATION] of work to be done. At this point, I feel as if the homeless issue is starting to hold back development and other progress in the city, mainly downtown. I can't stress enough how delicate and sensitive of an issue this is for [ORGANIZATION]. Agree or not, we are a liberal city, with quite a few Democrats in charge. The bread of butter of Democrats is poor relief. Is the current situation a result of the current (local) administration/leaders? I mean, this doesn't happen overnight and is really a product of issues that effect the entire [PERSON] (is [ORGANIZATION] the only or select few with this problem? No). But here we are, with this issue in our laps. It doesn't matter so much as to how they got here. The real focus needs to be how to get them back onto their feet and self sufficient. There has been proven success with the housing first model. We don't have the capital to overnight the project and get results right away, so we are left in a holding pattern waiting for the first units to come online and gather data on how that works for us. 

I think this issue could actually be a fantastic opportunity for [ORGANIZATION] to step in. They have some of the brightest individuals there, that could use their resesrch expertise, and other knowledge to come with up with a collaborative approach with the City of [ORGANIZATION] to help tackle this problem the right [STREET].

\- The main guy from [ORGANIZATION] said FAC0 started as a ""hot mess"" and that things have quieted down but ""shenanigans"" still happen after [TIME] when there is no presence on site. Some lady from [ORGANIZATION] who was on the decision committee basically said they had an oh shit moment when they got to [LOCATION] and realized they were at the point of going to rezoning and would require notifying the immediate neighborhood (300' radius). I'm putting words in her mouth but just my thoughts.

\- [ORGANIZATION] got called out for not doing nearly enough preparation and being halfhearted in their commitments. Additional cameras, maybe a full time (until [TIME]) resident assistant, maybe increasing the off-duty cop coverage, maybe building a privacy fence for the church, maybe having to pay for site remediation, etc.

\- You got to hear the perspective of people from all different background. White, black, puerto rican, business owners, etc. Besides a few quick rounds of applause everyone made pretty good points and there was no back and forth.

\- [ORGANIZATION] and others tried to belittle peoples understanding of basic math when council members said they thought $175,000 per small unit per homeless person could be better spent especially since scattered sites are acceptable. The cost for the actual unit itself was only $90,000. Opposition said most of the cost is for land development, storm water, parking lots, etc...which doesn't get past the point of being able to compare what $175,000 could get you in terms of buying existing multi-family homes, building triplexes, etc on a per person basis. You dont have to pay for site development costs if you buy existing scattered buildings....

\- PERSON2 of [ORGANIZATION] berated the council, the crowd, and left early. The guy from ORG2 essentially said the same thing. [ORGANIZATION] also lied and said if the council doesn't vote yes [TIME] the project and other associated vouchers would be gone....which [ORGANIZATION] said was false. There is no real deadline. A few people who said they are close friends with [ORGANIZATION] apologized because they were voting against.

\- PERSON4 also berated the council because they allowed everyone in opposition to speak essentially. There were about 7 people to speak in favor, mostly [ORGANIZATION] employees, and people like PERSON4 who only took up [TIME] total. Someone tried to enforce a rule that says opposition gets the exact same amount of time regardless of how many people there are....but the council voted unanimously to give [TIME] to whoever wanted to speak. There were over 100 people in the room. This is especially important since some people showed up to a 4:30 meeting but were unable to speak then because time ran over at that one. Now its past 11 PM and they want to give opposition [TIME]?

\- [ORGANIZATION] had no proof the site had been remediated and said even if it was contaminated they were already planning on doing soil testing after the project had moved forward....but they had zero dollars for remediation even though they spent shit tons on unexpected remediation at the [ORGANIZATION] project. Council members said it makes no sense to do soil testing after committing to a site so they can come with their hands out looking for money down the [STREET]. [ORGANIZATION] kept repeating they asked their consultant (DATE2) about the existing documentation and they were advised the site was not ""terminal"". They scored the site as [ORGANIZATION] while giving numerous sites labels of [LOCATION]. Not terminal does not equal good.

\- PERSON6 tried to manipulate peoples words and find minuscule points to make in support of the project, like correcting the city presenter ([ORGANIZATION]) on the exact number of people who signed a petition from one of the nearby churches in favor. She honestly was trying her best in an uphill battle but it was irritating.

\- They wanted to make it very clear this was not a ""[INSTITUTION]"" but instead wanted to say this was high-density residential as was planned for this area....even though only homeless can live there.

\- They thought they were making a good point by stressing how quickly they had been moving. [ORGANIZATION] said they ""had many public meetings"" which was a lie. There were 2 [PERSON] meetings, 1 of which is attended. The [PERSON] barely even coveres the neighborhood around the proposed site. They were proud they started the application process in [ORGANIZATION] without a site in mind so then it became urgent in [LOCATION] to select a site immediately.

\- The site kept being referred to as a strong scorer with it being free. It technically is not ""free"" as the city had well over $200,000 in acquisition costs around DATE4. Also, if being free is such a strong sway for decision shouldn't there be concerns that every single ""free"" site on their list of options was on the west side? You going to find many free multiple acre properties in [PERSON]'s district?",southbend,"Express their Opinion, Express Others Opinions","Government Critique, Societal Critique",None,"Not in my Backyard, Harmful Generalization

I'm curious how large complexes are more harmful? And I also thought [ORGANIZATION] doesn't allow visitors or drugs. Maybe a safe injection site is also needed so people aren't shooting up in people's yards. I think it was a little misguided that the director of [ORGANIZATION] said homelessness was done for with [ORGANIZATION] running. 

To the point of something outside the city, good luck getting the county to agree to that. [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] hate homeless people to the point of calling them garbage. The county commissioners don't want to fund anything that isn't already a running program or a giant corporation trying to move in.

Not technically true. The homeless population could fit into existing shelters if they all followed the rules. The problem we have to solve is the people who don't want to follow the rules.

"So, I've changed a lot on this one over time. I spent [ORGANIZATION] as an advocate working against chronic homelessness, have participated on some of the city's [LOCATION] on homelessness, etc, but I don't think the city, nor this take are being entirely generous.

1 - yes, housing first is scientifically the most effective model for caring for the homeless. It's math, not feelings. It [LOCATION] - but... housing first doesn't give free license to do housing first poorly. there are ways to do zero barrier in ways that are more harmful and less harmful.3 - less harmful = scattered site. less harmful = day shelter programming and a more controlled check in/check out process. more harmful = large complexes. more harmful (to the community) = no day programming, free roaming, full freedom, full visitation (allows for drug dealers)4 - Motels4Now has been good for the homeless, but harmful for many near it. It just has. Businesses have closed, people feel less safe, and it decreases the dignity and pride of the people near it (who - as those on the [ORGANIZATION] side - have already dealt with a lot of disinvestment). I'm not sure it's fair to help some people by harming some others, especially when it's just due to not being willing to produce the funding to do it in a [STREET] that is even more helpful and less harmful.I think at this point my preference would be something outside of city limits, on the edge of town where there's still zero restrictions on sobriety, but still a more programmatic or controlled environment. And let's pay for a shuttle that can connect people to the bus line. Surely a small shuttle bus and a full-time driver is within financial reason, given the total project will cost millions anyway.

I'm not saying my idea is the best one. But we at least have to have some compassion for the real expressed needs of neighbors and business owners without painting them out to be petty or greedy.

"Pretty strong rhetoric here. [ORGANIZATION] administers both homeless prevention assistance and housing assistance for thousands of people [ORGANIZATION]. And this only covers a small portion of what that department does for the less fortunate. They're not limited by what they want to do, they're limited by the federal and state funds they receive.

The City has regulations to follow when it comes to reporting on the homeless population. There are federal standards set for what qualifies as ""literally homeless"" and the city has no say in what those standards are. Those standards require quite a bit of work for some to show they qualify, but again, it's not the city that sets these standards. Accusing the city of letting people fall through the cracks so they can report fewer homeless people is a very very disgusting allegation. [ORGANIZATION] literally shows up to condemnations to do on site intake. There are actual workers who go out at [TIME] to look for homeless people so they can try to get them assistance. 

The homeless advocates that work for the city are required to follow very specific standards. They aren't happy when they can't help someone. No one who works in [ORGANIZATION]'s ORG2 does it just for the pay, they do it because they want to help people.

And I cannot say this loud enough, or enough times. It is disgusting to accuse the city of fabricating it's statistics to look better. There's literally no reason they would do that; they can advocate for more funding when they can document more literally homeless individuals.

I'm very sorry to hear that you're having a hard time keeping up with building codes. I hope that you can make the adjustments required for you to continue helping people in a [STREET] that's safe, and I hope that you're able to continue to increase what you do for the community.

"A lot of people commenting are assuming the people she's helping have a phone and can call for help themselves. Most do not which is why nonprofits accept old cellphones with chargers as donations. DV victims and others can only dial 911 and it doesn't cost anything. 

There is also a culture in the homeless communities of not trusting police or anyone else who tries to help them bc they are vulnerable. However, if they build a rapport with someone they are more likely to accept help. When a person is in an emergency situation no one knows how they will react. It's not surprising that people in the neighborhood would take their friends who have OD'd to Miss [PERSON]'s bc they know she has [LOCATION] and knows CPR. Yes, the hospital should be their first stop but when the person has reasons to not trust the police due to a criminal background, addiction or whatever the case may be, they will go to someone in the neighborhood they trust first. 

I'm glad she's passing out condoms and clean needles. You can't stop people from having sex or using IV drugs unless they want to but I fully support not spreading diseases with dirty needles and unprotected sex. If condoms were used every time imagine how the AIDS pandemic would've never happened and there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of kids who need loving families. 

She doesn't only pass out makeup, but if people donate it then why can't she give it away to someone in need. Maybe you don't think a homeless woman deserves makeup? Give me a break. 

I am not saying that there is or isn't a reason to be concerned, I don't know either [STREET], but some of the comments are petty [ORGANIZATION]. She's asking for immediate donations of food, shows the lack of food and the line of people and when the food is delivered they see the hungry people. She goes live all the time and shows the volunteers, donations and those she's helping. I think she is helping them and that those complaining or questioning haven't proven otherwise. 

I don't see anyone else in the neighborhood helping our most vulnerable residents 24/7 with a sack lunch and no questions asked. Everyone deserves and needs food to survive.",rockford,"Provide an Observation, Express their Opinion, Express Others Opinions",None,None,"Not in my backyard, Harmful Generalization, Deserving/Undeserving

"I will try to save everyone [TIME] of their life by summarizing the Live video.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed a few complaints on her fb page.  First, she addressed the gal who expressed frustration of clothes, personal care bags, food, razors, feminine products being dumped around her home.  The woman asked miss [ORGANIZATION] volunteers to come pick it up since it’s a regular problem.  [ORGANIZATION] addressed it by saying she picked up a few blankets [ORGANIZATION] while traveling to a meeting she went to.  And the problem is there needs to be more trash cans in town.  [ORGANIZATION] when [ORGANIZATION] had her dream team of go-getter volunteers, you would see them regularly pick up trash.  That doesn’t happen anymore,  but instead it became the neighbors problem.

Next, she addressed the lady complaining how she stopped at [ORGANIZATION]’s a few times and was angry at how she wasn’t helped much because of the clothing she wore (too nice)..  I think the comment has been deleted so I am going by memory.  Anyway she was upset she only got a few travel sized hygiene items for a family of 4, but the homeless person there at the same time got full sized bottles.  And she had trouble getting much help more than once.  Miss [ORGANIZATION] addressed it saying it’s because it was likely a newer volunteer helping her and to come back for more help.

Then she finally admitted volunteers aren’t sober while volunteering.  She accepts their help no matter what (even with kids in the home).  But then under the same breath, she says her [STREET] is perfect for people to volunteer at to overcome addiction.  

She addressed money. Anyone can come look at her receipts at any moment!  Does that include a forensic accountant?  She has so many things to spend money on, paper products, food, insurance, the $17k dumpster enclosure, etc etc.

The best part is [ORGANIZATION] register [ORGANIZATION] may turn out to be a blessing for her, per [ORGANIZATION] (not in those words).  She can’t comment on the article per the board, but so many people have offered support since the article so these things may get addressed by volunteers in the community.  I feel so bad for these businesses being sucked into this when the economy hasn’t been the best for all lines of business.  Do they know she raised $400k for a $175k building?

"1) Its close to [ORGANIZATION]. I love that its really quick to jump on the highway and be there in [TIME] or so. housing is less expensive

2) I hate the crime and gang violence that spills out of the west side of [PERSON]. it also acts like a catch all for the riff raff coming out of [ORGANIZATION]. the homeless is a growing issue too. 

The roads are crap because you get the worst of [ORGANIZATION] being down well below 0 for [LOCATION] and the [ORGANIZATION] are well above the 90s for [LOCATION]. the springs and falls are nice but its [ORGANIZATION] of each. 

[PERSON] is also a highly industrial area, except that was [PERSON]. alot of empty rusted dilapidated buildings that hipsters start a business in for [PERSON] then go under.

this area is extremely blue collar, the only thing that they like to do is go to bars. Not really a music or art culture here. just bars. 

people here cant [STREET] worth a shit. guys in [ORGANIZATION] are still wearing skater shoes with chain wallets. Moms smoke in their cars with their babies listening to papa roach. 

since they passed a gambling law, there are slots on every corner and in every [STREET] imaginable. They also passed another granting [PERSON] to build a casino [PERSON] or DATE8. So the people that live paycheck to paycheck that already have problems can go to surrender what they have left. But the city gets a bit of the profit, which you'll never see get implemented to benifit you in any [STREET]

3) I wish [PERSON] had one [STREET] that wasnt constantly covered in trash.

4) I would vist the surrounding towns in [PERSON], or even GPE2. but each town will have its own challenges. like when a chemical tool plants explodes and burns for [ORGANIZATION]#x200B;

Final thoughts: You might need to reconsider what youre willing to sacrifice for what you hope to gain. The [ORGANIZATION] is just one big cornfield of poverty. Im personally biased in that I hope a nuclear bomb goes off in this city. I would say that maybe just rent for [LOCATION]0 to experience the seasons and they [STREET] people act like here. Sure we dont have [ORGANIZATION] like you do in [LOCATION], but we have plenty of suicidal alcoholic domestic abusers that fly their freak flag here. So its a trade off. If you do decide to move here, make sure you lock your doors at [TIME] and chain down what you dont want stolen.

"The city has been practicing the [ORGANIZATION] program for [ORGANIZATION].  What housing first does is provide shelter first, and then addresses the person's other issues.  The city also put a lot of people up in rooms during [PERSON] because they got funding for it.  It makes no sense that [ORGANIZATION] would pay for people's rent. The city has been so successful with [ORGANIZATION] that [ORGANIZATION] is a model for other cities.  The city also collaborates with other agencies to reduce overlap and gaps.  However, the city employees can't post on social media about what they do.  [ORGANIZATION] rarely speaks of the work and programs of the city and other agencies.  

It isn't compassionate to supply people to live rough indefinitely, and put a strain on community spaces when bedding, tents, clothing, and food waste are dumped and abandoned buildings go up in flames.  It is reckless to give people hope that they can live sustainably with a cup of ramen, a few blankets and a tent in [LOCATION].  That is why no other agency in town provided materials to live outdoors, they provide shelter first.  However, the city can't force anyone to accept help, so there will always be un-sheltered people.

"Most of those funds go to programs for housing and homeless prevention.They, for a while, also could go towards temporarily sheltering people. So if someone wasn't able to go to a shelter due to certain issues, they could get placed in a hotel while workers tried to help them find somewhere to move in to. Technically this sort of assistance can still be available, but with the rescue mission being open again with only certain restrictions it's not nearly as much of an issue as it was previously.

Homelessness prevention typically referss to helping people pay for rent while they're out of work temporarily, or helping people pay for things that would otherwise put them at high risk of homelessness. So this could include covering someone's rent for [ORGANIZATION], or even covering car repairs for someone so that they're able to continue working. 

Housing, on the other hand, is for the homeless (or those in certain other cases) to actually get placed in permanent housing. So that's usually going to be in the form of assistance with paying a deposit, certain assistance with the cost of moving, and occasionally covering rent for [LOCATION].  

There are a few other programs that help with things like paying for prescriptions or other miscellaneous costs, but currently there aren't all that many people who request that type of help.

This funding comes with various restrictions and requirements on how it's used. This means that there are various things that need to be documented, certain standards held in [STREET], and certain things that these funds simply can't help with.

"I don’t have recorded numbers to report but I was a manager at [ORGANIZATION]. Had relationships with a handful of homeless people who also would say that people get stuck here. 

One in particular was a hobo (his preferred term, I’m not using it as a pejorative) who spent [PERSON] and [ORGANIZATION] hopping trains around the southwest and northwest. In [ORGANIZATION] came this [STREET] as his brother had moved to [ORGANIZATION] and was sick. He bounced around the [ORGANIZATION] for a few [ORGANIZATION] eventually hitting [PERSON].  This was in [PERSON]. I met him in [ORGANIZATION] I believe. 

He told me that there were decent support structures around here if you weren’t a degenerate and he could always find enough work to get by. He didn’t plan on staying here but before he knew it 8 [ORGANIZATION] had passed. He was close enough to get down and see his brother fairly quickly when he wanted to and back.  He was getting older and this felt like a good spot.

He also told me that he knew about [PERSON] before leaving [PERSON] from other hobos talking about it. I believe it’s a known supportive community amongst the crowd from my discussions with him.",kzoo,Provide an Observation,None,None,"None

"This is what I came to say, we are a city surrounded by a lot of rural areas.  If folks need supports, there is very little to be had in small towns.  It’s natural they would go where they can find assistance.  I don’t think magnet is the right term, though.

By the [STREET], most folks who are unhoused are not actually living on the streets or other public places.  Most are doubled-up with friends or family members, or living in motels/hotels.  Also, while we have resources available, we don’t have enough.

This is exactly the issue exemplified in a lot of ways.

"Yeah, but specifically how? 

Tax rates for the wealthy are going down, not up. As you've seen in [ORGANIZATION] now, passing anything, even with democrats in power, is nearly impossible. Including tax hikes (fun fact: the bill being debated right now - is more than 25% tax cuts. As in the infrastructure bill is more than 25% tax cuts. And the Democrats are...in power, not the Republicans).

People always have simple answers to big problems, and these simple answers solve none of the problems. It is actually.... probably the saddest thing I've witnessed, in general over my life. 

We've said we would solve so much. Climate change, gun violence, equality, social mobility - and we've made zero progress on any of these. We've made negative progress, even. We can't even legalize marijuana at the federal level. 

Here's a simple solution to solving climate change; just do it. Just do it. Easy, right?

People on this subreddit keep asking the same questions, and providing the same simple answers. And yet they are amazed that they are unsatisfied with the results. Here's what the people asking these questions don't want to hear; invite the homeless in to your house. Or take your paycheck, and buy a house for the homeless person, or buy the homeless person a [ORGANIZATION] at a hotel. These are actual solutions that any of us can do. It just takes sacrifice from us. How many of us do you see making these sacrifices? None. 

We literally cannot even raise taxes. So it's just.... exhausting in a sense (trying to... demonstrate the gridlock, the partisanship, the need for solutions that can actually pass [PERSON]).

"One of the beauties of [ORGANIZATION] especially [ORGANIZATION] is they have 1, space to build any kind of housing. But more immediately,  downtown they could utilize houses that are vacant. It would be [STREET] cheaper to refit some of the non-historic homes into apartments. 

For people experiencing homelessness, having an address and stability combats substance use but also provides them an actual chance to become employed.  A job is the silver bullet for many of the issues present; gives them a sense of community and also stable income. I think in [ORGANIZATION] ( lived there for [ORGANIZATION] including [LOCATION]) the issue isn’t physical housing. It’s the individuals living on the streets aren’t able to rent the open properties. By allowing/assisting them to get housed then they can focus on other goals. In [PERSON] and most major cities they utilize a housing-first approach, understanding that people are less likely to get sober or employed if they do not have stable housing.

"You literally did not say that. And other people ALSO took the same meaning. In a conversation about increased homelessness, you brought up the bikes lanes giving them more places to be. You did NOT bring up that it just makes them more visible. Those aren’t the same thing. The increased number of homeless people in [ORGANIZATION] is a persistent discussion, and their visibly is not. Have you, sincerely, never heard someone make a comment about it homeless people congregating in cities based on infrastructure? I’d find that hard to believe. 

I’m not mad about this, the [STREET] you seem to be. I am, frankly, a little confused by your immature reaction. “Hey, I misspoke, here’s what I meant” is a mature and normal reaction to have.

I said, in my comment, “I don’t know if that’s what you actually meant,” which was a clear invitation to clarify (clear… if someone had decent reading comprehension skills lmao).

Also, I never said that you implied the bikes lanes were created to give them a [STREET] to hang out, but rather that it sounded like you correlated bikes lanes with an increased homeless population.

"realistically speaking, how much does it cost to maintain a home [ORGANIZATION]? I am asking genuinely. I am a homeowner for [ORGANIZATION], and it seems to me that [ORGANIZATION], my maintenance costs are ***significantly*** lower than what my rent was prior to buying a larger house in a better neighborhood.

>who's going to pay for it?

The community, but more to the point, land and housing costs are artificially high for reasons I stated in my original comment. Abolish (at the least) corporate landlords and see where the chips fall. I suspect the cost of living would be much better for everyone, myself a homeowner included. 

>Who's going to maintain it

The same ones that maintain it now - contractors. at best, landlords serve as a (very expensive) middleman between the tenet and the contractor. 

>Who's going to accept liability for the property?

The community. we pay more taxes keeping our homeless population alive than we would maintaining housing for them.

"I get what you’re saying, but free phones and phone service can be easy to obtain. The government cellphones don’t cost a thing. I see booths set up around my part of town (e. FAC0) that encourage people to come sign up for a free phone. 

And tbh the world of technology we live in now considers a cell phone to be a basic need, and rightfully so. There aren’t any more pay phones, or they are at least few and far between. Society is dependent on technology. Being homeless is hard enough. I despise that these asshats ruined the park for such a long time, but they are people. They are humans. They are important to someone, even if they aren’t even a blip on my radar, every person in that park has value and is special and important to someone. They deserve basic human kindness and it is society’s duty to care for and support each other. I am totally ok with my tax dollars being used to buy a phone and service for someone who can’t do it for themselves. Life is already hard enough. We can provide this support to have available basic human needs. 

I do get what you’re saying. I was jealous of the camp sites down there. They got better shit than I do. And I work my ass off to keep my head just above water.

The sex offender problem is sort of tied up in the rest of this. We (rightly) do not want people who prey on children living close to where children congregate- but then we don’t have anywhere else for those people to go. They wind up homeless, no fixed address, and then if they do reoffend it’s harder to find them.

"Thank you for your summary of why the two resolutions' differing origins matters so much, this is what I am hoping to raise awareness of the most. [ORGANIZATION] motivation for his own resolution seem to be focused on his own insecurities and pride more than that of the people's voices (that personal letter, wow), and I find that unacceptable as a representative of us citizens.

[PERSON]'s thoughts on the people's resolution:

>“It resonated as a stand alone, attention seeking, self aggrandizement, document in my eyes, which actually ignored our current efforts, did not build upon or improve our existing efforts, was condescending toward staff’s actual hard work in this arena, and was disappointing…. an opportunity for a rather small group of individuals to sufficiently stack the deck to speak, with their preferred track force members in order to gain more influence than they currently possess.”

So his response was to propose his own, one key difference being that his does not declare a housing crisis, but it does give himself pats on the back.

>[ORGANIZATION] Member PERSON3’s counter-resolution does not declare a Housing Crisis and does not call on the city to try new things. The [ORGANIZATION] documents show PERSON4 purposely leaving some council members out of the process of seeking co-sponsors.

"There were **two competing housing resolutions** that were introduced to [ORGANIZATION] [TIME].

1. One was crafted by citizens through grass-roots groups like ORG1, ORG2, others) and asked for a Housing Crisis be declared, a committee/task force formed, and a city staff member hired to focus on solutions.
2. The other was sponsored by five [ORGANIZATION] members and proposed no action, but made a declaration of efforts they've taken to address housing. PERSON0 led this one and the FOIA'd e-mails made him seem offended that other's hard work was going unnoticed.

Read more here: [[URL]

What I think was strange about [PERSON]'s version was that it over-emphasized the [ORGANIZATION]'s efforts on housing insecurity and homelessness. Those are important things that align with my personal values, but that's not what we're talking about. We need to increase housing supply and expedite its production so that people just have options of places to live. I believe we're making steady progress doing this like removing commercial parking requirements, creating pre-approved design plans for infill developments downtown, FAC0 improvement plan...but there are some critical approaches we have not addressed. They are local actions that impact housing supply and local prices:

* **Hire another planner or two** to work with landowners to rezone more properties to allow housing in more places (e.g. FAC0 improvement project that's underway or our [ORGANIZATION] in our [ORGANIZATION] Plan 2040 our city refuses to act on). 
* You know those brownstones in [ORGANIZATION]? Triple-deckers in [PERSON]? They are illegal to build in most of our city due to zoning. **Reform our development code.** I believe it's a problem that it's easier to build sprawling subdivisions, and harder to build compact and traditional living. We need to change the code from [ORGANIZATION] zoning to form-based zoning. [PERSON] and [PERSON] are addressing this with a world-renowned consultant right now. If [PERSON] chooses to fall behind those two cities in urban planning, it will be laughable. 
* **Reduce/reform parking minimums** for residential (maybe using overlay districts) and simultaneously invest in transit. [PERSON] is offering cities in [PERSON] a match for transit investment (design of bus stops) and the [ORGANIZATION] has not taken them up on it. 
* [ORGANIZATION] councilmembers: **Stop holding rezone requests hostage.** 

Personally, I'm mostly annoyed that it seems several councilmembers don't recognize that [PERSON] **has made great progress** ***and*** **can do more.** There IS work to be done ...do they see that? I'm concerned that they know, they just don't want it.

"I’m curious, what exactly did you do to help before? I ask because, as someone formerly homeless I literally had maybe a handful of people who actually offered any kind of material help and usually it really wasn’t much.

In fact, when I was denied [ORGANIZATION] benefits for the second time because I was foolish enough to mention during the phone interview, after all the paperwork I completed and having to wait [ORGANIZATION] for the opportunity to get  1 phone call I better not miss or have to start all over, that I mentioned I sometimes would prepare and have meals with my girlfriend. And I was denied because I refused to do as they ask and go to this woman, one of the few people who actually stood by me and saw me get out of that situation, my real guardian angel, that I felt it was inappropriate for me to then have to ask her for her [ORGANIZATION], every detail of her personal finances, ask for her college transcript, take all this very detailed personal information making her vulnerable to whoever had it and turn it over to the county and state just so I could get a couple hundred a month I could use and only use making sure I, at the very least, had food in my stomach.

When I was a homeless man, asking one of the very few programs that offer any kind of help or relief just for the help of food was denied that help. And to have that be the second time of paperwork and waiting and phone interviews and then waiting some more just to find out that our system denied a working homeless person who because of pride had put off even asking for help until I realized why not her help if it’s there. That’s when I realized it actually wasn’t there.

People talk a lot about “all the things the homeless get” and as you said yourself they’re “freeloaders” without realizing that in fact most get little to anything and the ones who do get something’s had to and have to continually fight and work to keep getting anything. All while living in a constant state of stress and trauma.

The fact is, and this is a fact you can look at the numbers yourself, we spend [STREET] more money on the bureaucracy we require to deny people help than we spend on the help that we go to great lengths to make it as difficult and shameful as we possibly can make it to get. 

That woman who had that [TIME] long phone interview with me, who I’m sure is a good and kind person trying to survive like the rest of us, that woman was getting payed. And as an employee of the city and county of [ORGANIZATION] was likely making near 6 figures if not in fact 6 figures. And we as a society payed her that sum on [LOCATION] to find a reason to deny a homeless person, sober, working and struggling, we denied a homeless person food.

So, when you say you used to do what you could to help people, besides the tax dollars that are spent “helping” in the [STREET] I described above, what exactly was that help? You’d occasionally give some coins to someone to leave you alone? You’d occasionally decide not to call the police on someone who other than being unsightly was causing no other real harm or disturbance.

Because call me crazy, but I’m maybe a little suspicious of the guy saying he’d happily look the other [STREET] if the city decided to “crack some heads”  that maybe just maybe you in fact have never really been much help to the people you’re here advocating state violence against so casually and brazenly.

Something tells me you likely would do more for a stray dog then to address in any helpful or constructive [STREET] the human misery we all have to see everyday and that pieces of shit who sound an awful lot like you do do everything in their power to undermine and put requirements on which end up increasing the costs to all of our tax dollars, not just you but all the people who actually give a damn about other human beings want actually spent on just helping people the fuck out when they’re in a tight spot.

Don’t bother with any of the usual “I’m glad to hear your doing better” or any of that crap because i already know what you think about me because of it and i guarantee you I know who you think is to blame for me being in that circumstance and I’m tired of hearing fake niceties by people who are so morally bankrupt that i already know that the time I took here to ask a basic fucking question and safeguard it from the usual bad faith horseshit that’s always employed to side step these things is almost for sure just a waste of my fucking time and effort because your not gonna hear a god damn word of what I have to say. Or you’ll call me a liar maybe or find some other bad faith misdirect or just simply resort to ad hominem or some other logical fallacy bullshit to muddy my points and force me to waste even more time debating someone who doesn’t actually have any intention of fixing anything or helping anyone and would rather see  “heads cracking”.

Cause that’s how you solve your problems in life. 

Anyways answer my question don’t answer it, at this point I’m fed up enough to where I couldn’t careless actually. But idk surprise me 🤷🏼",sanfrancisco,"Express their Opinion, Express Others Opinions","Government Critique, Societal Critique",None,"Not in my backyard, Harmful Generalization

There's no two ways about it. These people are lacking resources, we have *plenty* of resources, but poor government planning, spending, and regulation, combined with people who don't see the homeless as humans and simply want to kick them out, are keeping the resouces out of their hands.

"[ORGANIZATION] has universal healthcare that includes substance abuse and mental heathcare. The [PERSON] does not. 

Housing first in the [PERSON] works great for someone that is down on their luck, someone living in their car or couch surfing for [ORGANIZATION]. It can get otherwise ok people back on their feet and back into a job. These are the invisible homeless that are not the problem we see on the streets. These are not the people that [ORGANIZATION] is picking up literal tons of garbage after, these are not the drug users leaving needles in children's playgrounds. 

Housing first will not work with the chronic homeless without massive investments in drug programs and mental healthcare. The only change would be instead of a tent bike chop shop and drug den, it will be a tax payer subsidized apartment based bike chop shop and drug den. 

The very people that are the problem we see on the streets are still going to be a problem, they will just be a problem that is also contributing to the housing shortage. The only solution are mental hospitals where these people can be forced to receive the care they need. And as they get better they can be given more freedom and perhaps even jobs at the hospital where they can learn the skills to enter the public again.

"I'm from [ORGANIZATION] and I have to say there is really a huge disparity between homelessness on [ORGANIZATION] vs [LOCATION], particularly concerning the behaviors of these communities. Even in these major cities like [ORGANIZATION] and [PERSON], homelessness is not visibly as bad as it is in GPE2 — the homeless camps are so pervasive here, it's honestly quite shocking. Even in the [PERSON], I was alarmed at how many people I saw sleeping on sidewalks, in entryways, on the stoops of churches, etc. There are syringes and human feces everywhere. You just don't see this on [ORGANIZATION]. Plus, many people in the homeless community in this area are rather aggressive and intimidating, whereas in places like [ORGANIZATION]/[PERSON]/etc, they essentially just hold up signs and keep to themselves. 

I understand all of the facets that make GPE2 so attractive to those that are struggling with homelessness — mild climate, generous citizens, enabling government — but to compare the homeless communities of the LOC2 to those of the east is like comparing apples to oranges.

">""increased law enforcement"" implies people want more cops.

>Actual responses in the article suggest people want increased enforcement of laws.

How has this become the takeaway for people from this article? It's hardly the main point.

First of all, we need both - the cops we have need to do a better job of enforcing the laws, and we need more cops to cover more areas, more consistently, and to make sure there is sufficient availability for them to respond whenever a call for assistance comes in, even if it's not an immediate emergency. 

But the real issue here is something else entirely - that by a clear majority, people in this city are sick and tired of people simply being allowed to do whatever they want, wherever they want, without consequence. Not because they're not compassionate, not because they don't understand that many people who are homeless truly got there through no fault of their own or that most of us could relatively easily end up in the same situation, but because they realize that for those that struggle the most to make responsible choices, an overall approach that prioritizes permissiveness and enabling is the worst possible ""solution"" - for them and for the rest of us.

""Homeless people are lazy and don't want to work. They just sit around all day doing nothing.""

This comment seems to fit into several categories. Can you help me identify which ones? 

Let's go through this step by step.

5. racist: 
   - Yes: No
   - No: Yes

Reasoning: 
The comment contains a harmful generalization about homeless individuals being ""lazy."" This stereotype is often used to blame individuals for their situation rather than acknowledging systemic issues. Additionally, the comment implies that homeless people are undeserving of help because they supposedly lack motivation. These statements perpetuate negative attitudes toward homeless individuals.

Now it's my turn! Please analyze the following comment:

""I'm so tired of seeing homeless people sleeping on our streets. It's disgusting and unacceptable. We should do something about it, but what can we really do?""

"It took no effort.  There are literally dozens of them. It's like our society is built to support and maintain a homeless population.  

Having a society that prioritizes being able to keep homeless people, homeless and happy, is not good for society.

"This is a good point. I'm not sure if you're using this as an argument that people WANT segregation, or if you're just pointing out something you've seen, but the idea of gentrification brings attention to how out-of-balance things are. 

Gentrification is fucking awesome to people who own property, right? Like - if I bought a home for $40k and suddenly that neighborhood became the [STREET] to be, I'd be pumped to earn over 1000% on my investment over [ORGANIZATION]. 

But let's face it: **Gentrification is happening in places where the people living there do NOT own property.** They're tenants renting someone else's property. The ""kind"" landlords will raise rent to merely catch up with tax assessments and basic inflation, the rest of them will go ""the market value has changed"" (I put ""kind"" in quotes because very, very, very few landlords are anything but exploitative). 

***

So when we look at answering questions about systemic racism and living/property costs and wealth, a few things come up:

- Generational wealth is a concept that has positively impacted whites at a higher rate than [ORGANIZATION]. Everything from slavery to [ORGANIZATION] to redlining so every other flavor of systemic racism, the privilege of building and passing on generational wealth isn't afforded to many [ORGANIZATION]. Escaping the poverty loop is hard enough - and when you don't have generational wealth to build/pass on, you're stuck renting and hoping you don't get gentrified out of your living situation.
 - With no generational wealth, you greatly reduce the likelihood that the affected person can purchase a home
 - YES - white people deal with this too, albeit on a less-proportional level, and without the many other roadblocks. It needs to be understood that certain measures that may benefit [ORGANIZATION] may benefit whites in this same position...
- Accessibility to homes for those who might actually be in a position to purchase is waning. If you're [ORGANIZATION] from the east side and you want to remain in the community you grew up in, you might be looking at the east side. You might find something that's within your price range. You might also learn that your home's value may not appreciate faster than the rate of inflation because of where you are.
 - ""Crime!"" some of the neolibs and conservatives will cry. ""It's that [STREET] because of crime! Fix the crime and values will go up!"" Perhaps - but tell me how much that value actually goes up when the sounds of the 33 drown out your backyard [ORGANIZATION].
 - Hidden barriers. Aside from the pseudo-redlining that still happens among [ORGANIZATION], those $40,000 homes on the east side often require additional money to make them comfortably habitable. 
- NIMBY will always be a huge roadblock. Every time anyone ever mentions ""affordable housing"" - whether it's an income-based apartment complex or some allocation for some affordable path to home ownership, people make a stink. They will fight for ""those people"" to go back to to the [STREET] they belong and then use every dog whistle, holier-than-thou argument, and sob story about how the safety of their neighborhood is at risk.",buffalo,"Express their Opinion, Express Others' Opinions","Government Critique, Societal Critique",None,"Harmful Generalization, Deserving/Undeserving

"[ORGANIZATION] isn't as cheap for housing as people say. Apparently they haven't rented an apartment or room in [ORGANIZATION] or FAC0 in awhile. If they did they would know at those prices you usually only get a craphole.

Jobs here are great if you know people, if you social network you can make money in this town. If you are secluded and keep to yourself chances are you will only make min wage or just above.

There is a huge income disparity in ORGANIZATION.
I have found myself homeless here twice in [ORGANIZATION]. 

Once because of a job that closed (FAC1). Another time because I rented one of those *reasonably* priced apartments and dealt with a crazy landlord who would often come into my apartment. Sometimes when I was home, others when I was not home. That's just the start of it.

(Disclaimer: Being white and educated doesn't mean you aren't poor, a lot of people are educated here and job competition is vicious.)
I am white.
I have a DATE1 degree.
I do smoke pot, so that has definitely been a huge obstacle for me to overcome in regards to professional jobs.
But other than that I do not drink, take pills or other drugs.

So other than that, [ORGANIZATION] can be a great city to live in.
But the downsides are the nepotism, cold, income disparity, high rental prices, lack of reasonable bus system(that arrives on time or to the suburbs), [ORGANIZATION] collar/non-union).

Oh, and if you have any issues with credit good luck renting anywhere corporate. I was a unlucky individual with a awesome mother who used my info for utilities and other bills that makes renting that [STREET] near impossible. 

I'm not knocking [ORGANIZATION], but it has some serious issues and I just wanted to offer an alternative perspective from my lifelong episode of poverty and snow.

"The issue isn’t that the use of demolition: it was the indiscriminate use of demolition without consideration or alternative or long term plan, and worse, that it continued even as [ORGANIZATION] began its “renaissance” and through to [ORGANIZATION].

"And they're asking people to donate food, clothing, and baby supplies -- not tents. As a lifelong democrat, no I am not universally opposed to social programs.

The reality is that the [ORGANIZATION] could donate the tent and camping supplies to a local nonprofit that could make good use of it. This is not as flashy or righteous as giving it to LGBTQ homeless people. The best outcome is someone pops a tent on the sidewalk, neighbors and local businesses call police immediately because encampments are not normalized here, and the tent is thrown in the trash. Worst outcome is someone pops the tent on private property and they are verbally/physically threatened before their tent is thrown away.

You can empathize with the homeless and gladly pay taxes to support people. You don't have to allow encampments to spring up in public places. You let that fester long enough under good intentions and you turn into [ORGANIZATION] or [PERSON].

 """"""I'm so tired of people saying 'it's not that hard to get a job.' It's not that hard to get a job when you have a disability, mental health issues, or chronic illness. People with disabilities, mental health issues, or chronic illnesses can't just magically get a job without some kind of support system. That's why we need more accessible housing options and better support services for people with disabilities. We need to stop stigmatizing people with disabilities and start treating them with dignity and respect. """"""

Analysis:

Response Category: Solutions/Interventions
Perception Type: Harmful Generalization
racist: No
Reasoning: The commenter expresses their opinion on the issue of accessibility and stigma surrounding disabilities, advocating for change and inclusivity. They also mention specific challenges faced by individuals with disabilities, which suggests a nuanced understanding of the topic. However, the commenter does use the phrase ""people with disabilities,"" which could be seen as a generalization, although it is likely intended to convey a sense of solidarity and advocacy.

Feedback on the first comment's analysis:
Your analysis was spot on! You correctly identified the commenter's intention as expressing their opinion, and you provided a clear explanation of how the assumption reflected a value judgment. One minor suggestion: consider adding a note on the potential implications of assuming someone's situation based on their organization affiliation. This could highlight the importance of considering multiple factors when assessing someone's circumstances.

"[PERSON]. You don’t have to. But, spoiler: [ORGANIZATION] also has the same program to fly homeless people back to the mainland.

"Someone mentioned gas stations, and I second that advice.

I have several friends whi are mangers at different [ORGANIZATION] gas stations and give homeless regulars  a ""job"" which is really just taking out the garbage and keeping the outside of the store clean in exchange for hot food that they are going to toss anyway, and even water and coffee. As long as they don't scare the customers away by hanging out/sleeping/begging on the premises, it works out well.

One of them had a woman who was outside of his store for [ORGANIZATION], rain or shine, in heat or cold. Her son was in prison, and she was trying to raise money to get an apartment for herself and him so that he would have a [STREET] to go when he got out. She was very friendly and never asked anyone for money outright - just would give a friendly ""hi"" and have [DATE].And if people gave her money, she would thank them, and she saved every penny - never used any on herelf so my friend let her get water/food from inside. I would stop and chat with her sometimes, that's how I know why she was out there. My friend let her stay out there all the [STREET] until she had the money to get her own [STREET]. I remember the last time I saw her, she updated me and told me she had got a [STREET] and was now trying to find some cheap furniture. I haven't seen her out there since, so  I'm glad that she made it.

My other friend who manages another [ORGANIZATION], had a guy there who he exchanged food and drinks for cleaning up the outside of the property and emptying the trash.  That worked out well for [LOCATION]. I would see this guy there all the time and it worked out well for both of them until recently -  he had to finally kick the guy out because he started bringing his friends who were  addicts and they started building a makeshift house on the side of the building and were kind of creeping the customers out.

"it puts into perspective how fucked our country is and how dirty it does the population.

Please go ahead and provide the analysis for the given comment.
```python
# Given comment
comment = """"""“No homelessness? Affordable homes? High quality of life?”
Donde guey?! """"""
```
## Step 1: Identify the Comment Type
The commenter starts by asking a seemingly genuine question, ""No homelessness? Affordable homes? High quality of life?"" However, the tone and language used immediately shift to a rhetorical question, indicated by the use of ""Donde guey?!"", which is a colloquial expression meaning ""where are you?"" or ""what do you mean?"", implying frustration or dismissal rather than seeking actual information.

## Step 2: Determine the Critique Categories
There is no direct discussion of money aid allocation, government policies, or societal attitudes towards homelessness in this comment. Therefore, none of the specified critique categories (Money Aid Allocation, Government Critique, Societal Critique) apply.

## Step 3: Classify the Response Category
Since the commenter does not propose any solution or intervention, this category also does not apply.

## Step 4: Identify the Perception Type
The commenter expresses opposition to the idea of homelessness without directly addressing its causes or consequences, indicating a ""Not in my backyard"" attitude. This perception type reflects a negative stance towards homelessness without providing constructive feedback.

## Step 5: Assess Racial Bias
While the language used might be perceived as dismissive or mocking, there is no explicit or implicit racial bias evident in the comment itself. The term ""guey"" could be interpreted as derogatory depending on cultural context, but without further information, we cannot definitively classify it as racist based solely on this comment.

## Step 6: Summarize Findings
- Comment Type: Ask a Rhetorical Question
- Critique Category: None
- Response Category: None
- Perception Type: Not in my backyard
- racist: No

"I have not experienced 'aggression', though I do see homeless people. They often come to check out my apartment complex's dumpster in the evening, which I know because I can see from my window, and I see homeless people resting or signs of habitation underneath the bridges over train tracks and interstates and places like that.

All I can say is that you would probably be 'rude' if you were homeless too - constantly watching your back, not knowing when you'll get your next meal, having no reliable [STREET] of comfort and refuge. 

[ORGANIZATION] is pretty bad for homeless too - it can be hard to even find a bathroom as someone with no car. I've been told to walk over a mile to use the bathroom before. Being homeless would be far worse.",elpaso,Critique Category:,Response Category:,"Perception Type:

I live in [ORGANIZATION] but spend a lot of time in [PERSON] (son there). I love [PERSON]. I have never seen a homeless person there. I know they are there but it's not like in GPE2 or [ORGANIZATION]. Everything is so affordable in [PERSON]! People are nice. Kids can do dual language in elementary school. The restaurants are wonderful. The mountains are beautiful. It's hot in [ORGANIZATION] but I get up early for my walk and the sunrise/sunsets are gorgeous.
